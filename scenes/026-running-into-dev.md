# Running into Dev

Running was always theraputic.  The ability to just get lost in my mind.  I've always been a fan of working out, it's a go to thing to do but when I need to think I run.  So I run every night before I make dinner.  It's a habit I started in school and have just been doing since. 

It allows me to think about the day.  Process the stresses and push it into my legs and arms, and moving through the city streets.  I ran the same circuit everyday so when I saw Devin coming out of a building that I passed by everyday I had to stop.  He kept popping into my head and now there he was.  I grinned and I ran up beside him as he walked in the direction I was going.  I was a little out of breath but I managed, "Fancy meeting you here."

He glanced over to me and smirked.  "Fancy that.  Are you stalking me?"  He joked.

"I was out running."

"I see that."  He said with amusement in his voice.  "I was heading to Aspect, covering for a friend."

I nodded.  "That why I've never run into you before?"

"I suppose.  Could be I was waiting for you to run by?"  He said with a sparkle in his eyes and I stopped.

"You've been waiting for me?"  I asked a little dumbfounded.

"There has been this pretty boy running past my windows for months now.  I didn't recognize you at the club.  Your movements aren't the same.  But I see the same grace as when you are dancing.  The long clean strides.  Dee thought I was crazy watching the pretty boy run by everyday.  Never even bothering to get his name and his number."  Dev laughed.  "And it turns out he's the boyfriend of one of our lovers."

I felt my heart sink.  "One of them?  You have other lovers?"  I asked.  I don't know why I should be disappointed but I was.  People like this weren't into manogomany.  Hell until a few weeks ago I wasn't either.  It wasn't until Sage shared with me desire to watch that I knew I only wanted to be with him.  Sharing was not something I really wanted to do but Sage didn't want to share with just anyone so I was open to the idea.  I was okay with him being with someone else.  I just wasn't sure I needed to be in that kinda life style.

Devin frowned.  "You project a lot."

"Wait you heard all that?"  I asked and frowned.

"Sorry.  Yeah.  If you are having doubts about this, we don't have to."  Devin sounded disappointed.

"No it's fine.  I was reflecting on the idea that I didn't want that kinda life, not that I wasn't open to sharing my lover.  I didn't think that you guys would have had other pairs, or other singles.  That's all.  No worries."

Dev's laugh was hearty and it made me smile.  I liked hearing him laugh.  "I should have phrased that differently.  He's one of my lover's boyfriends.  Not our lovers meaning we have multiple extras.  The last guy who shared our bed left to go be with a girl he'd met in Maraco.  She wasn't into the whole polyamourous relationship.  We've never actually had another couple.  But Sage came looking for me at the club a few weeks back.  He's not a very good flirt but he tried.  And then we ran into each other at paint ball, had a drink and we decided to go for a movie.  I intended it to be just me and him, but Dee refused to let me go alone.  I knew Sage was looking for another guy to fill his bed, not a couple.  But he and Dee hit it off.  They hang out more than I hang with them these days.  They have this board game thing they like.  I get so bored when they go one about it. I don't know why he doesn't bring you along."

"I've been working, he's been meeting up with you guys during the day and I can't get out of it."

Dev shook his head.  "He wasn't ready to share you.  He's afraid you'll leave him."

I laughed.  "And yet he's the one who's out looking for a third."  It was ironic.

We turned around the corner and stopped at an alley side door and I looked up and smiled at the camera and stopped my slow jog I'd been doing. It was pointless now.  I would walk the rest of the way home.  We were at the employee entrance for Ascpet, we'd talked the whole way to his shift.  Dev smirked at me.  "You and I should hang.  No sex without the others, but no one said we can't get to know each other."

I laughed.  "Are you asking me out on a date?"

Dev smirked.  "Maybe."

"What did you have in mind?"  I wanted to kiss him.  I could almost feel the touch of his skin on mine and the weight of his body on mine.  

"Do you do that on purpose?  You'd make a lousy hunter all those thoughts."  He asked.

I shook my head.  "Sorry."  I pulled my shield around me and sighed at the mental drain it was.  I hated being a rock.  I hated not lettng my emotions show.  

Dev's eyes went wide.   "Fuck me.  Okay.  Yeah.  Don't do that."  

I blinked at him in confusion I wasn't sure what he meant and he seemed to understand because he clarified for me, "Don't block that hard.  I mean you were there all lust and desire and then the next second completely gone.  I don't mind hearing you.  Most people don't like it though but I can't help but listen to you.  Never happened before."

"What do you mean?"  I asked as I let my shields down.  I'd be more careful but up the walls a little more each day until it became natural to shield more.

"No don't shield more.  It's okay.  I see it hurts you now to hold the shield while you aren't hunting a telepath."

"You saw that," I sighed. 

"I know what you are, Nox."  He ran his fingers over my right temple and the tattoo.  "My folks registered with your headquarters when we moved here.  My dad was a telepath too.  My mom didn't know, she thought it was just lost kid registry, didn't realize my dad registered too.  Dee doesn't know though.  So your bounty hunting story will have to stick around until you are ready to tell the truth.  I know it's hard when you kill people like us for a living."

"I do not kill people for a living."

Dev laughed.  "So I've heard.  I've asked around.  There are a few vampires who come into the club and when I asked if they knew this tall Venatori with a scar on his cheek they all asked if he painted his nails and dyed his hair.  They told me your name before Sage introduced you.  Said you were Il Cane's pet Venatori."

"I'm not her pet.  But they don't know that.  We just work together when necessary."  I said.

"Il Cane's not someone you mess around with is she?"  Dev asked, "The vamps all shut up when I asked any other questions about you."

I grinned at him, "So stop asking around and ask me what you want to know."

"I don't have many nights off, you sure you can't get away for lunch?"  Dev asked.

"I can get away for lunch.  We could meet at Bonnie's?" I said.  We were setting a date - one where sex wasn't even on the menu.  

"I can do tomorrow at noon.  I'll have a bout an hour and a half before I need to be at work that day.  Expecting a shipment and it's my turn to come in early."

"Sounds good."  I smiled at him and gave him a little wave, but he caught my hand and pulled me close.  "I said no sex, but I'm not about to let you go without kissing you."

I smiled as he pressed his lips to mine.  He tasted sweet like candy and I wandered what he'd been eating before he came to work.  He bit my bottom lip playful and I let out a small moan.  Dev pulled away from me and waved, "I'll see you tomorrow Nox."

"Tomorrow Dev."  I took off at a jog backwards before turning around and running back to Sage's.  It wasn't far and I was suprirsed how close it was.
