# Hallway Bantaer

I didn't have time to deal with whatever they were having problems with.  I walked down the hall towards where I knew Levi was.  I could hear people in room as I past them.  I felt the fear and smelt it as I went.  It got stronger the closer I got the the boy's room.  I looked at the locking mechanism and frowned.

I hadn't really been paying attention but now that I'd stopped I smelt jasmine and lavender mixed in the fear.  Sage stepped around me and pulled out his phone and a few gadgets he had in his coat pocket.  A touch to the small of my back made me freeze and Dev pressed his lips to my cheek, "It's okay pretty boy."

Sage was busy.  Dev's hand was at my back I could think the thought and have a private conversation like they did but I whispered instead.  "What was that about?"

Dev frowned and pressed another kiss to my cheek.  "That's between you and Sage."

I pulled away from Dev.  "The conversation was between the two of you."

Sage sighed.  "Tell him."  He continued to work on the lock.

"Sage wanted more.  Our conversation was about tonight."

"What about tonight?"

I saw a grin on Sage's lips and Dev started signing softly in my ear.  "Stars shining bright above you / Night breezes seem to whisper "I love you" / Birds singin' in the sycamore trees / Dream a little dream of me."  With each verse Dev pulled a reaction from my body.  If they ever got me alone in a room where there were no boundaries, I'd be putty in their hands.  Fuck!

I grinned, "You want me to dream of you tonight?"

Sage chuckled.  "Yes.  That's what he's asking."

Dev grinned, "We are going to try something."

The door clicked open and Sage turned to me and stepped closer.  "Nox.  We can make this work."

I smiled.  "I missed you."  I pressed my lips to his.  When I pulled away I grabbed Dev's shirt and pulled him close.  "You too.  I missed you."

Dev pulled away first and nodded towards the door, "Let's see the boy."
