# Finding Emma

We sat wrapped around each other for a long time.  No one bothered us here.  We'd only be kicked out if there was a scheduled lesson.  Sam stopped crying and I hugged him tight before I held him away from me.  "Can you take me to Emma?  We need to stop this."
 
Sam nodded and stood up and took my hand.  "This way."
 
I stood up and pulled my shirt and hoodie down and followed Sam through the halls of the Academy to another orange door and I tried not to let my fear of what we'd find.  The rooms were sound proof but you didn't hear any sounds coming in.  We went up stairs to the observation room and saw Emma with her hands pressed to the wall and Sam gasped and I felt my heart jump into my throat.  Garrett was standing behind her whispering in her ear.  Sam's hand tightened around my hand.  He pulled himself closer.  Fury rose up inside and I touched the intercom button.  "Open the door Garret."  I was a lot braver when I was this far away from him.  I didn't know if it's would last, but I wasn't going to let him hurt that little girl anymore.
 
He looked up into the observation room looking for me, but he couldn't see, he knew better. I touched few more buttons on the panel with the intercom and then I went down stairs and I pounded on the door.  Garrett opened the door and had tentacle of air behind him like he did in my nightmares.
 
Sam hid behind my leg and held onto me whimpering.  I glared back at the man.  "You won't hurt them anymore."
 
Garrett laughed. "You think you have a backbone now?"
 
The air whip cracked in the air and I stood my ground.  "You will not hurt them again!"
 
A second and third whip joined the first and they all began cracking in the air like thunder.  Sam was crying behind me, clawing at my leg and it spurred me on.  I was waiting for him to hit me.  If he'd just hit me I'd be in my right to fight back.
 
Garrett laughed at me and he turned towards the little girl who was standing oblivious to what was happening around her, she was lost in the dream of her mentor.  The same dream Sam and I knew well.  He let one of the air whips crack against her skin.  She screamed silently still lost in the dream state but the pain was real. But the blood and the laceration on the girl's skin were real and that was more than enough for me.  I flung an net of air at Garrett and he flew to the wall behind me.  I spoke softly to Sam.  "Wake Emma, Sam.  Wake her and go upstairs and do not open the door for anyone but me.  Do you understand?"
 
Sam nodded his head and he went Emma and shook her and shook her until she came out of the daze crying.  Her body was already healing but I wrapped her in the elements as they left and hoped it wouldn't scar.  "Shut the door behind you."
 
Sam and Emma hurried out and the door closed behind them.
