# A Long Talk

The look on my face or the thoughts running through my head must have queued Dev into something.  His smirk changed from it's normal curve to a frown as he grabbed my t-shirt and pulled me towards him.  "It's not one of those talks pretty boy."

He leaned down and pressed his lips to mine.  I felt Sage's hand on my leg and I wished he'd move it higher.  But Dev moved away and smiled at me.  "Just heavy stuff."

Sage chuckled.  "Real heavy."  He patted my leg and left it there.  The warmth pooled in my body and I groaned as I straighted my body back from Dev's manhandling.  "Dev said you wanted me to look into a Levi and Amelia."

I frowned at the memory of Amelia and the description Cliff gave me of what remained of her body.  Dev sighed.  "I'm sorry Nox."

"I didn't know her."

Sage interrupted.  "I know you didn't know her she's been dead a good twenty years."

Dev sighed, "We saw her last night.  Sage showed me a picture earlier.  Dead on."

"She's covered in black vines according to Cliff." I said.  I shivered and Dev's hand touched my cheek and he ran his fingers down my cheek and over my jaw line.

Sage chuckled.  "He looks at you like he's a puppy in love."

Dev laughed.  "I think he is and it's killing him inside."  He looked at Sage with a grin.  "He's in knots."

"I'm sitting right here."  I said but Sage and Dev were looking at each other, Dev's hand was holding Sage's hand against my knee.  They were having a conversation in Sage's head that I wasn't privy too.  I pulled myself from between them up into the corner of my bed.  I didn't want to know what they were talking about and I didn't want to be in the middle of it.  They were talking about me that much I knew.

Sage shook his head and seemed to be shaking the cobwebs out when he saw me in the corner of my bed with my pillow in my lap and my body shaking.  He squeezed Dev's hand and Dev looked at me.  He looked like he wanted to say something but he didn't just looked at me and stood up.  "Tell him about Levi."

Sage stood up and moved away from Dev and me.  "Levi is a in the infirmary he's insane.  But I don't have much more than that."
Dev smiled.  "But Dorian has more."

Sage nodded.  "Levi was a student of Garrett's.  A few years after you.  He said he was promising student.  Like you.  His words exactly."

The information was good.  I beleived it.  I knew I had to move.  I knew I had to get up but there was a personal problem holding me here.  Sage and Dev had a conversation about me.   And I don't think it was a good thing.  I crawled out of my corner and left my room with my boys still standing there staring at each other.  Fuck!
