# Shields

I woked up to my alarm and Dev turning it off.  He rolled over and smiled at me.  "You wake up to fucking early pretty boy."  He pressed a kiss to my lips.  "You get up, do your thing, I'm gonna stay here a while?"

I laughed.  "I don't know how I'm going to be ablt to top our lunch date if this is the first date.  I mean, you've got me half naked already, in a bed.  Lunch is going to be such a let down."

Dev smirked.  "I'm sure we'll manage.  Unless you plan on staying, get up so I can sleep."  He shoved me.

I sighed.  "If I wanted to stay?"

Dev pulled me close and kissed me.  "I think we can think of something."

Our bodies felt good against each other.  I could feel his errection against mine.  Dev rolled over on top of me and smiled.  "I think we need to stop now."  His body pressed against me and I hummed in agreement.

I grinned up at him, "What should we talk about then?"

Dev rolled to the side and but I stopped his movement with my hands on his hips.  "Stay.  No more, just stay?" I asked.

Dev redistributed his weight on top of me and leaned his head on to his hand and looked down at me.  "I have a serious topic if you want to discuss it."

"How serious?  Being on top of me going to be problem?"  I grinned up at him.

"I have another skilled, part of the dream walking."  Dev confided in a quiet whisper.  "While you slept I took a look at your shields."

"You can do that?"

"It's part of what draws me people.  I saw Sage's shield downstairs while he dozed.  His is strong.  Drake's is perfect and Fae's is a little weak but it's getting stronger.  Your's?"  He pressed his lips to mine.  "Your's is fucked up."  He smiled at me, "It's a tangled mess.  It has black veins keeping your shield from completely closing.  I've never seen anything like it.  I might be able to do something about that."

"Like what?" I asked.

"Strengthen it, get rid of those veins would be best. I'm not sure how yet, but I think I can help.  I've helped Dee's a little, her's is impentrable.  Nothing in and nothing out, everyone lets something out it's human nature."  He looked at me and smirked.  "Not that you are human."

I pressed my lips to his and whispered, "Half human."  I sighed.  "I should get up.  Get a shower, clean the rest of the blood off me.  "Stay for breakfast?"

Dev grinned down at me, "Nap, and then breakfast?"  He rolled to his side but half his body was still on top of mine.  "I'll take some pancakes if you don't mind."

I rolled on top of him and looked down into his baby blues then pressed a chaste kiss to his lips. "I can manage that.  Breakfast will be ready at 6."
