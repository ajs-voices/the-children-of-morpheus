# Wolfliked Tendancies

Jo curled up in my lap on my bed.  I sat against the wall a pillow behind my head trying to rest, but knew I wasn't going to get any sleep.  Morning came I felt the sun's arrival.  It was odd feeling that distant pull of the moon, knowing that tonight was the real full moon.  It was the first time I'd felt it.

The girl in my lap sat up straight and then scurried away from me to the other corner of the room.  She looked around and then at me.  Her face was frantic.  I smiled at her, "You shifted last night.  I forced you back into human form and brought you here to watch."

"Why?"

"Because you shifted and I wanted to keep you and everyone else safe."

"I could have hurt you."

I smiled at her, "Yes, but you wouldn't have."

"Why?"

I shrugged.  "I don't know why.  I'm not a wolf.  I just knew you wouldn't.  We will need to speak with Adrian or Dom."

"Who are they?"

"They are the pack leaders of the city.  You probably need to join Dom's pack.  It'll be safer for you and everyone else.  He's a good man and he's a good leader."

She got up on all fours and sniffed the air in my direction.  She got closer, sniffing the air.  I tried not to move and tried not to feel awkward, being sniffed by a human was disconcerting.  Jo pressed her nose to my skin and pulled away with a sneeze then rested her head in my lap.  "You smell ... right."

"I smell like pack right now I imagine since I borrowed their power."

"Borrowed?  You aren't a wolf?"  You smell like me."

"I'm not a wolf.  Not even close."

Jo lifted her head then looked down the length of her body and saw she was naked.  She pulled the blanked up around her and saw her clothes at the foot of the bed.  I got up and stood facing away from her.  "You don't want to look at me?"  Jo sounded upset.

I grinned but knew she couldn't see it.  "Jo, I've seen you naked.  I'm being a gentleman."

"I've been naked all night why didn't you put clothes on me? If you were being a gentleman."  She growled at me.

"I didn't want to ruin your clothes if you shifted again.  You were covered the whole time."

"Did you look then?  I mean really look?"  Her hand was on my elbow and she turned me towards her.  She was still standing there naked.  I kept my eyes on hers they were easy enough to keep my attention as they glowed amber with wolfly power.

"I didn't."

"Why not?"  She sounded offended.  "Am I not pretty enough for my alpha?" Her voice dropped and then she stalked away gto get dressed.  "I don't know why I said that."

I grinned.  "Because you are a wolf now, the female wants to attract the attention of the alpha so she can breed.  It's a whole thing."

"You don't find me attractive?"

"I do.  And I could do more with that if my love life wasn't already complicated enough as it is."

"You love someone else?"

I sighed, "Two someone elses actually."

"Two?"  She turned back as she pulled her t-shirt over her head.  "What are they like, I bet they are prettier than I am."

I smiled.  "I wouldn't call either of them pretty in the sense you are speakng.  They both have beautiful bodies.  Sage and Dev are both different."

"Wait...."  Jo stalked to me, "You are saying no to me because of two guys?"

I laughed.  "Jo, I prefer men.  I like women.  I enjoy sex with women but my heart is with them."

"So what was all this?"

I sighed and stepped away from Jo.  "This was protecting you from yourself.  From hurting someone else.  From doing something you can't forget doing.  I was saving you."

"I'm not a werewolf."

"You are.  You are acting like a wolf just a moment a go.  I've been around enough females and their alphas to know."

Jo stalked out of my room like I was the bad guy here.  She would turn again tonight and the following.  But she'd not remember the transformation for a few more months.  This was a dangerous time.  I sat down on my bed and slouched against the wall.  I was tired...
