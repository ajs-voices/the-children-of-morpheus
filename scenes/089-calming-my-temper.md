# Calming my temper

I was about to let my power flair around me when I heard a small voice clear behind me.  I turned to see the cutest brunette.  When I say cutest I don't mean she was the cutest thing I ever saw.  Because I'm sure I'd seen cuter before.  But Dee stood in the door way wearing a plaid pleated catholic school girl skirt and a black t-shirt with a unicorn on it and under it said "I will cut you."  Her hair was pulled away from her neck in a low pony tail and she wore the sheerest amount of makeup.  I knew that only because I'd seen her go to bed without any a few nights back.  Well two weeks but still.

She smiled at me though it didn't reach her eyes.  Something was different.  But she cut through the fury with like a hot knife.  Dee kicked the door and it closed behind her.  Her hips swayed as she walked and I watched each movement until she was standing directly in front of me.  I looked down into those green eyes.  They were darker than usual, colder too.  But her smile was warm and inviting and she touched my cheek with the back of her hand.  "Why don't you shave?  Our other boys do.  This will be so scratchy."

I smiled down at her, "I've never had anyone complain duckling."

She laughed, "Because they were distracted by other bits I'm sure."

"As you would be.  And there are three of us, plenty to distract you."  I bit my bottom lip and she hummed at the gesture.

"I suppose I'll get used to it.  But why don't you shave?"

"I look like I'm twelve without it."  I said with hatred.  I worked my ass off to be what I am.  I wasn't about to be asked if I could drink every fucking time I went into a club.

"You can't look twelved darling.  Your eyes say so much more than that."

"Yeah well most people aren't looking at mey eyes."

She stepped closer, her body pressing against mine.  "Did you see Sage and Dev last night?"

She pushed me back a few more steps and I yielded until my legs hit the back of my bed and I sat down.  I was looking up at Dee and she looked down with a seductive grin.  Those eyes were darker still.  "I wanted to see you since I couldn't join you."

"We didn't do anything."

She grinned.  "Oh I know, Sage was upset that Dev came back shortly after he fell out."

"There was an emergency here, I had to go."

"Dev didn't mention that."

I shrugged.

Dee pulled her t-shirt over her head and my fingers clenched in the blankets on my bed.  She smiled down at me, "Would you like to touch me?"

"Yes."  I breathed out slowly.

She laughed and shook her head.  "Well not now, lover boy."  She lifted her skirt and straddled my legs.  I had to fight to breathe.  Her body was hot against mine.  She took my hands and placed on each of her as cheeks and rocked against me.  I pulled her closer against me and she rocked again.  Her eyes stayed locked with mine, until she was panting hard and her head fell backwards.  My body ached for her.  She bit back her orgasm as she rocked against me through the height and let down.  I was rutting up to meet her seeking friction for my own release but she froze her movemetns and chuckled as I groaned my displeasure.

Her eyes had gone black, but there was no time to react as she pressed a kiss to my lips and I yelped at the electrical charge that passed between us.  And then there was nothing but the thick suffocating darkness.
