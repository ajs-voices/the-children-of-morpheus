# Finally

Sage and I had some fun in the wake of my meeting Dev and Dee.  It was a unqiue experience.  Sage asking a lot of questions about what I wanted.  What I needed.  He seemed very keen on the idea of sharing me with others.  I wasn't sure about it still, but I was happy to make Sage happy.  He was like a new person.

I was up and ready by 6am.  I had breakfast and the kids moving by 7 and we were all at the AU building by 8 on time and ready to go for our days.  It was Saturday, but I still lived in the building, and technically so did Matt.  Though we spent most of our time at Sage's.  Matt had a special pass to stay with us.  He couldn't stay the night on the weekdays but every weekend he was with us.

We were still finding a place for Faelen.  He wasn't eager to go to school with Venatori.  And I wouldn't be after what he'd been through.  But he didn't want to be around other therians.  The idea scared him more than it did being with the Venatori.  And I wasn't sure I wanted him in a human school.  We had a few more days to figure it all out before people cam knocking on our door.

But what surprised me most about the start of my day was that a note was sitting on my desk at work on top of all the files Dae'lin wanted me to look into.  I still wasn't doing field duty.  I was lucky I wasn't on mandatory leave after having been taken control of my a powerful dragon.  And then I thrawted a Venatori ploy and now I was working against them, even though they didn't know that yet.

The note read:

> Dear Mr. SÃ©tanta,
> We have granted you an hour of time with Jeffery Taylor and Marvin Thomas  starting at 8:30 today to extend till 10:30 in the fish bowl.
>
> We realize there is a conflict in your schedule but this is the only time the boys are available.
>
> Sincerely,
> Richard Weston, Headmaster

It was about damned time.
