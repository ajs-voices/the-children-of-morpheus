I leaned back against the chair and let my head fall backwards.  I ached.  My body still was still repairing itself it seemed and I had expended a great deal of energy in the fires.

There was a knock on the door and Madison was outside, "He's in here.  We'll have someone bring his lunch down so you can have as much time as you'd like to spend with him."  I looked up and saw not one but both of my blue-eyed boys and I grinned at their appearance.  Madison laughed.  "He hasn't smiled like that since he got here.  I'll leave you guys two it."

Dev stood in the door way and watched Madison walk down the hall.  "She's cute."

I nodded. "Uh huh."  I made sure to think of the first time I'd see Madison and what we did.

Dev's head snapped back in my direction with a smirk.  "Damn it, pretty boy!  You have to stop doing that."

Sage looked at Dev then back at me.  I shrugged and Dev chuckled, "He was thinking about his first time with Madison."

Sage turned a pretty pink color as he asked, "You've slept with her?"

"She was my first."

"Your first ever?"  Sage asked.

I nodded.  "Yeah.  We had a crush on the same guy.  She came up to watch him at swim practice while I was taking care of things and she took pity on me and we had sex on the floor of the empty classroom."

Dev was shutting the door behind him as he stepped inside.  Sage looked at him, "And you saw that?"

"No, but he was thinking about it.  That was more details that I gathered."  Dev explained.

Sage frowned, "You don't see things in my head like that do you?"

Dev turned Sage to face him and pulled him against the front of his body and pressed a kiss to his lips.  I got a front row seat to Dev and Sage kissing and a small groan slipped from my lips.  I ached for so many other reasons in that moment.   Dev whispered against Sage's lips when they parted, "I don't pry, deadshot.  I promise you unless you want me to I won't dig.  But I do hear what you are thinking.  I can't help it, it's like a connection is built between us and you share thoughts with me.  You block your's well.  Pretty boy doesn't.  He kinda just falls out."

Sage laughed.  "He does that with his voice too.  On and on and on about what he feels.  He'll make some girl happy one day.  Sometimes I think he just needs to shut up and man up about it."

I stuck my tongue out at Sage and he raised his eyebrow.  "What did I say about that?"

"I don't know lover, what did you say?"  Sage took a few steps towards me and I grinned at him.  "My body hurts.  Be nice."

"Are you saying no?"  Sage asked.

I shook my head.  "Never.  Just be gentle."

Sage laughed.  "I can be that."  He sighed and so did Dev.  "But we came for another reason."

I sank deeper into my chair if that was even possible.  I so wanted to just curely up with my boys.  All of them really.  "Where's Dee?"

Dev frowned, "She had to pick up a double.  She hasn't been home at all lately.  After spending the time here with you when she could, we've all been picking up extra time."

I sighed.  "I'm sorry."

Sage punched my shoulder, "You should be."

"Ow."  I said rubbing my arm.  "That's not gentle."

Sage grinned down at me and then leaned over and kissed me.  He tasted like coffee which meant he'd been working a lot too.  I hummed against his lips. I wanted so much more but I put my hands on the edge of my chair and gripped tightly, I'm sure they turned white from the tight grasp.

"Sorry Nox."  Sage said as he helped me stand up by my elbow.  He directed me to the middle of the lumpy bed and sat down on one side of me and Dev sat on the other side. I leaned back so my head rested against the wall my blue eyed boys turned so that they could see me.  "We have some things to talk about..."
