# Scars

I woke from sleep groggy and unsure where I was.  The sun was streaming through the window and there was a room wide buzzing going on.  I'd slept through my usual time.  I rubbed at my eyes wondering what time it was.  There had been dreams - dreams of Dev.  And Sage and Dee.  There had been dreams of the boys, of that mysterious tree.  I was sore as I got up out of the lumpy bed.  I missed my bed.  I'd be happy sleeping alone if I could just have my bed back.  I wanted to be back with Sage, but that wasn't going to happen.

There was a buzz and my door opened and a perky little nurse walked in with a smile.  "You have an early appointment."

"I need to change."  I said.

The little nurse nodded and closed the door and stood there waiting.  I shrugged to myself I had no problem getting naked in front of anyone.  She wasn't precisely the person I wanted to be naked in front of but whatever.  I didn't make a show of hiding myself, but I heard a small gasp as I pulled off my shirt and she saw the scars lining my back.  I heard her take a few steps then stopped a few feet from where I was changing.  She whispered, "You poor boy."

Such a pity party. Like I was showing you to get sympathy.  The little nurse closed the distance and put her hand on my back and I froze.  My heart raced and I could feel sweat beading on my forehead.  "Please don't." I managed to breathe out.

Her hand jerked from my back and I turned around pulling a pair of jeans on.  "I'd appreciate it if you didn't do that again."

She nodded.  "I'm sorry.  What happened?"

I shook my head, "It doesn't matter.  It's in the past."  I didn't want to talk about it with a stranger nor did I want to talk about it at all.  Now that I was fully dressed she lead me out of my room and to a different therapy room.  Great, this was just what I needed.

I sat down in the overfluffed couch and waited.
