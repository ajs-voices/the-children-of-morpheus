# Lunch with Dev

I got a text from Dev as I hit the lobby from the stairwell.  "No problem.  Not there yet either."

Neither of us were really late, but it felt good when we both showed up outside Bonnie's at the same time.  I reached for the door handle and a hand touched the smallof my back and I froze a little before there was a soft breath against my neck and the faint smell of citrus touched my nose and Dev spoke softly, "Fancy meeting you here."

"I thought we had a date, it's not fancy at all."  I grinned at him.

I opened the door and the door tinkled.  Dev walked in before me and I let the door close behind me.  Bonnie looked up from her customer she was waiting on with a smile.   The booth in the back corner was empty and I took Dev's hand and lead him to it.  Bonnie stared at our hands and she frowned.

It wasn't long before Bonnie came to our table.  Bonnie's frown was deep and it made her look much older than she was.  "What happened to Sage?"

Dev laughed.  "Sage and I are seeing each other too, Ms. Bonnie.  It's all very open, no hiding."

Her blush was bright.  "I..."

"Bonnie, I'll have my usual."

Dev grinned up at her, "Tactfully put. I'll have what he's having.  Ms. Bonnie."

Bonnie nodded.  "I'll have your drinks in a few moments.  Coffee?" she asked Dev.

"That's fine.  Cream and two sugars please."
