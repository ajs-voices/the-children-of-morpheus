# Calling Dad

After dealing with a bunch of dip shit parents I needed to go for a run.  I changed clothes in my apartment and then I went for a run.  I ran for a good hour before I found myself at Sage’s house.  I called my Dad while I sat down on the front stoop of his house.  I was still catching my breathe when he picked up.  “Hello?” he said.
 
“Hey Dad.  Can you pick up Drake and watch him.  I’ll come get him later?”
 
He chuckled, “What about Faelen?”
 
“He can stay in the studio when he gets out of school.  You can stop by if you are hungry I’m sure he cooks better than you do.” I teased.
 
Kai laughed, “Of course he does.  I don’t cook.  And your boys are too spoiled to eat in the cafeteria.”
 
“Will you pick up Drake?”  I asked again.
 
“Yes, son, I will, I love my grandsons.”
 
“They love you too Dad.  I’ll call if I can’t make it home, but Fae can watch Drake for the night.”
 
“They can both stay with me Nox.”
 
“Thanks Dad.”
