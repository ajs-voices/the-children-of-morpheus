# Breakfast

Between the time I had woken up and I was able to actually leave my room had been enough time to get in another longer workout and I found I was able to walk a lot better.  Still weak and it strained my muscles but thank god for Venatori metabolism and healing power.  I was thankful for that.  I walked under my own power past the room with the screaming boy.  He wasn't there which concerned me.  But there was no one around ask.  The hall was conviently empty.  I leaned against the wall to see if someone would happen by but Jo walked past me with her head down cast.

I caught up with her but she didn't even look at me as we walked down the hall.  She tried to speed up but I kept pace.  I grinned. "I'll make you talk to me eventually."

Jo didn't look at me but she sat down next to me without hesitation. "I can help you," I whispered to her before the others joined.  Cliff was absent which was concerning too.  Why were people missing.  First the boy, now Cliff.

Lori was her chipper self as she sat down all bubbly and bouncy.  I almost wanted to get sick she was so sweet.

Madison showed up at our table with our medication.  I rolled my eyes but said nothing as I swallowed the throat constricting pills.  It was the same sensation but I couldn't exactly prove it so I didn't say anything.  I knew my body better than that, I knew I wasn't imagining it but it was gone before I could even mention it.  I would be crying wolf.  And I didn't do that.

Cliff came out as they were serving breakfast.  I didn't even see what was in front of me when the server set it down I was consumed with Cliff's red eyes.  "What's wrong?"  I asked him.

"Amelia..."

"What happened?"  I asked more concerned that the ghost had done something stupid than something happening to her.  I mean what could happen to a ghost?

"She's dead."  Cliff cried.

"How?  She's a ghost."  I said.

Cliff's voice cracked as he spoke.  "I found her lying on my bed just lying there covered in black veins."

I inhaled sharply.  "Fuck me..."

Everyone at the table was staring at me.  "What?"

"What's wrong?"  Duke's voice rumbled with concern.

"I can't say for certain.  But I saw Amelia last night.  Darkness was swallowing us so I told my friend to take me home and leave himself.  I figured Amelia would do whatever it was she'd do.  There was a mara there."

The word didn't seem to phase any of them.  I sighed and I wasn't going to get much help here now that I was in the crazy ward.  I was going to be deemed crazy.  Ghosts and maras and dreamwalkers.  What the fuck?  And a wolf girl who no one knew was a wolf.  How stupid were people?

I don't think it had to do with stupidity.  More with ignorance - they just didn't understand the world outside.  Inside the Venatori were so ingrained in tradition, things outside of it were ignored.

I barely noticed the frittata on my plate.  It wasn't very good, I barely tasted it.  But I ate, my body needed fuel.  I had to get a computer.  I had to do some research.  Fuck, how was I going to figure this out?
