# Marvin

Richard brought the second boy in and introduced us in much the same way.  Marvin Thomas was very different form Jeffery.  Where the other boy had been quiet and timid Marvin was the exact opposite.  He was wore a leather cut and his hair was spiked.  He had tattoos all up his arms.  The idea of doing that to myself made me shiver, but the boy seemed to thrive on the biker motif.  He sat down and the chair squeaked loudly under the mucscle weight.  He was a big boy.

He looked at me with dead brown eyes.  There was no life in them, he reminded me of Garrett.  "I'm not going to get all weepy and hug you like that pansy in there."

I nodded but didn't get a chance to say anything as Marvin continued in his tough guy voice.  "I ain't got no problem you can help me with."

But I could see the fear in his eyes.  He hid behind the mask, the same as I did.  I grinned at him.  I could play this game too.  "That's fine.  I still want to talk."

"About what?"  His eyes dropped.  He'd failed to intimidate me and make me back off.  I could see the gears turning and the weaves around him darting around.

There was one thing about these three kids that I noticed, all of them had better control that most adults over the patterns.  Even in their fear and their anger they kept them constant.  I smiled at him.  "About what Garrett did to you when you were a kid."

"He didn't do anything."  The lie came out harsh.  His eyes darted to the sides to see if anyone was around to listen.

"No one can listen in.  I turned survelince off myself and shielded the controls with air, so unless they've broken my pattern, which I'd know about and they haven't, no one can hear what we say."  I confided in Marvin.

"He didn't do anything."  Marvin tried to sound convincing but I could still hear the fear in his voice.  It was much like mine.

"So he didn't make you see him hitting you in your head.  He didn't take control of your gift and beat you with it while you slept."

The blood left his face when he heard my words.  "No."  He chocked out.  He was going to lie even until the very last strike.

I shrugged.  "You can say that all you want, it doesn't make it true. I know the truth.  And I think I can keep him from you.  If you let me."

There was a glimmer of hope in his dead eyes.  But he stayed stern faced and scowled at me.  "Does it require me getting all weepy and clingy?"

I shook my head.  "I don't even have to touch you."

That made the boy's scowl fade a litle around the edges.  He wasn't going to hurt himself anymore trying to hid his emotions behind it.  "Is that a yes?" I asked.

He nodded.  And did the same thing I'd done three other times today.  I wove my connection around him.  I may not be able to protect myself from Garrett, but I sure as hell would do it for these.  I needed to talk with Adrian still, but I knew the kids were safe.  They'd never be hurt by Garrett again.  No one would touch them again.
