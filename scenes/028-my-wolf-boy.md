# My Wolf Boy

Our night was strained even after my shower.  Matt came for dinner with news that there was a guy at the Academy who liked him.  Sage cautioned him against guys like Tim.  And Matt reassured Sage that no one was going to do that to him again.  Somewhere in the woods Matthew Davenport had gained a spine.  I loved watching him grow.  Of the boys he was probably the one I dotted on the most.  Mostly because he didn't live with us permanently and he had a bad home life.

Both Sage and I understood the loss of parents.  We both understood that Matt needed that little bit extra attention.  Even though it was also the same with Faelen.  But Fae wasn't letting us in.  He curled around Drake at night when he couldn't spend the night with Matt.  Fae found himself alone in bed when Drake grew too hot. Which was becoming an occurance more often than not.  I'd taken Drake to the infimary and they said he was fine.  He wasn't even running a fever.  But he was hot to the touch and Fae was already hot blooded.  We didn't know what was going on.  I had a feeler out for the Dragon council but so far nothing had come from it.

Faelen was curled up in his bed when I checked on them and he smiled at me.  "Nox?" He whispered.  "Those kids you brought in to the pack.  They are like you?"

"Yes."  I said as I laid down next to him.  He curled in against me.

"Am I like you?" He asked.

"You are more like me than those other kids are.  We come from broken homes, all of us do.  You, me, Sage, Drake, and even Matt.  We all have at least one parent how's passed on.  Those other kids had bad things happen.  Like you and me and Sage  and you get the picture."

Faelen rolled over and looked me in the eyes.  "Will they come live with us too?"

I shook my head.  "No they have parents who love them dearly and wouldn't want them to leave them. Would you want them to leave that?"

Faelen smiled and shook his head.  "So no more kids for a while?"

I laughed.  "Just the three of you for now.  But you know that won't be forever, right?"

He nodded.  "I just want to get used to my new home before I have to be the big brother."

I hugged the boy, "Fae you are a great big brother, Drake loves you."

"He likes Matt better."  Faelen confided.

"Nah.  Matt is just better with people.  Drake likes spending the night with you.  You play with him and you are here for him."  I hugged the wolf to my body and took a bit sniff of the forest smell.  Each one of the boys was comforting in their own rights now.  They were growing on me, their smells becoming home, mixing with Sage's in his house.  It truly was becoming our house.
