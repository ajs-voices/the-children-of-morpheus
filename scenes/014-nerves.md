# Nerves

I wasn't a date kinda guy. And this felt very much like this was a date.  I was cooking.  Sage was comfortable with them.  They'd been on a few dates but that was about all I knew except that he smelled like them everytime he'd seen them.  

Sage was wearing blue jeans and a black t-shirt with Tony Starks arc-reactor in the center of his chest.  It was one of my favorite shirts so I knew what it was.  He was grinning at me while I was cooking our dinner.  Sage had requested I make garlic and white wine chicken with whatever sides I wanted.  He even said that he eat a regular old tossed salad if I made that.  

So I made what Sage asked.  It was staying warm in the oven while I took a shower and tried to find something to wear.  Sage was doing the casual thing, but he was already comfortable with his friends, I'm not sure I was.  I remembered being nervous the first time I took Sage out.  And now was really no different.  Sage came up behind me and wrapped his arms around me while I was putting on my eyeliner.  He pressed his cheek to my scars.  "There is nothing to be nervous about."

"I'm not nervous." I lied.  Sage laughed and pressed his lips to my back.  

The door bell rang and Sage jumped.  "I didn't know that worked."

"I had Dorian send someone over to fix it.  Same with the squeaking back door and the basement door."  I said.

Sage turned me around, "How much did that cost you?"

"Don't worry about it."  I said and pulled him down to kiss.  I loved that I was shorter than him.  It was a novelty.

The bell rang again.  "Shit.  This isn't over."  He kissed my cheek and walked out of the bedroom.  "Wear the blue long sleeves.  It's my favorite."

I grinned, "Okay."
