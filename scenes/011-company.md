# Company

I was nearly done with lunch, it was just sandwiches made from left over steak we'd had the night before.  Sage would just eat it plain, I liked to use it to make something else with.  But Sage ate anything I offered him.

Sage walked into the kitchen with a smile.  "I always like seeing you cooking in my kitchen."

I smiled back at him and when he came close enough I pulled him close by his hip and kissed him.  I told him, "I think it's my kitchen now."

He laughed.  I loved that laugh, the one that said he was happy.  His blue eyes were bright with joy and I could see them darkening with lust.  But he took a step back and separated us with the island.  The island was often used that way, when we got too intense.  Which happened often.

"Nox?" Sage asked and when I looked at him he continued on.  "This Friday, I invited over some people.  I'd like you to cook something impressive and meet them."

"Alright."  I said as I pushed a sandwich in his direction and took a bite of my own.  It wasn't anything special.  Just steak sliced then with mayo and mustard and fresh tomatoes and a good provolone.  I'd have preferred mozzerella and basil on it as well, but we didn't have any left since Sage liked the combination as well and ate it every night as a midnight snack.

"No questions?"  Sage looked at me over his sandwich.

"I assume you want me to meet the couple you've been seeing."  I said.  There was no judgement in my voice.  But Sage blushed none-the-less.  We had an open relationship.  I didn't choose to partake of the situation, but it was something Sage needed to do right now, and I didn't judge him on it.

Sage's eyes had dropped to his plate.  "You don't mind?"

I reached across the island and lifted his eyes to mine, "If you are ready then so am I.  If they are ready then that's even better.  I assume they know of me?"

He laughed.  "Yes."  He breathed out quickly.  I was missing something but he was done with the conversation and his fingers played along mine and he took them in his hand and we finished lunch.
