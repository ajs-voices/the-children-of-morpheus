# Protection
At the bottom of the stairs we heard Garrett open the door and when I looked down he was staring up at the three of us.  But he huffed and turned back down the hall and I assumed to security to see about getting the recording.  I stood up with the kids in my arms and let them find their feet.  "I have to get that recording."
 
The let me move but as soon as I was standing in front of the console they were attached to me again.  I worked as quickly as I could and saved the file of the camera to my phone which I then sent to Sage with a message.  "Keep this safe for me, love.  I'll explain in a bit."
 
He sent me a quick reply, "Got it."
 
I put my phone away and knelt down between the two kids and smiled at them.  I knew how to shield myself from a lot of things.  We could protect ourselves from mental intrusion by paths.  I don't know why I never thought of trying it with Garrett, maybe because I didn't realize he was still in my head. But these kids hadn't learned how to shield anything.  I knew pack magic could protect from some things, but I wasn't pack.  But Adrian insisted I was.  So I focused on that one truth, the hope that I could protect these kids from themselves.  I pulled on that invisible connection, the pack bond.  And I felt Sage, I heard him gasp in my head.  I felt Drake.  I blinked when I felt Matt there too... When the fuck did I did I do that?  Faelen was there too.  I couldn't see them, but I felt them.  I could sense them.  And at a distance I felt others but I didn't know what that meant.
 
I extended that connection to the kids I wrapped them in that sense of safety that was the pack.  The home, the forest, safe.  Family.  Pack!  They both relaxed in my arms and I felt them next to me both physically and mentally.  I don't know what it all meant, but if it kept them safe then I would take it.
 
I needed to talk to Adrian.  Or maybe Darwynn when he got back.  I kissed each of them on the head.  "I think you'll be safe now.  But you tell me if you aren't okay?"
 
They both nodded and I carried them down stairs and to their families.  I wanted to have a chat with them.
