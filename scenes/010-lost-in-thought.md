# Lost in Thought

I think I fell asleep in his lap because the next thing I knew he was tapping my back and whispering, “Nox.  I need to get up.”

I stretched as I extracted myself from his lap and he shook his head, “Like a baby.”

I grinned at him, “Hungry?”

“Always.”  Sage intoned.  And I went into the house via the stairs inside and into the kitchen to make something to eat.  The kitchen was still as gorgeous as the first time I’d seen it, but now it looked used.  Sage still burnt water - how the fuck do you burn water?  But I’d seen it happen, twice!

Sage’s fridge was always stocked.  Even when I wasn’t there for a few days Sage had home cooked meals.  And I didn’t bore him with my schedule of eating habits, I was learning what he liked and I made it for him even if I wouldn’t eat it.  It wasn’t the boyfriend thing I was doing, it was my thing.  The shit Sage ate he ate for convenience so I made it more convenient for him to stay home.  Sometimes Sage would ask for a full course meal so he could take it to his parents or have his friends over.  Usually I cooked those before they got there and they were hot when he wanted to show off.  I didn’t stick around I wasn’t ready to be that far indoctrinated into Sage’s life.  And he wasn’t either.    Though everyone already knew I practically lived with him.

It was still an argument.  It would be until things settled in, but I was working on it no matter how inactive it seemed to be.  I was always working on it.  But it wasn't easy being Venatori and it wasn't easy to leave the campus after living there so long.  Not that five years was a long time.  But it was what it was.
