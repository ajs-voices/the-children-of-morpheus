# Trades

I started asking around about how I could get some computer time and I was repeatedly asked when is your group's time?  I had no idea.  No one gave me a schedule, which meant that it looked like I got it many an hour or so day.  Lori said we could go just before lunch.  I sighed and waited as we sat in front of the TV and had control of the channel.  Everything was scheduled including who controled the TV.  I didn't care and I found out quickly I could sell my time slot for junk food.  Not that I wanted that.

Duke laughed when I held on to the bag of unopened chips I'd sold my time slot for.  "You can sell that too if you aren't going to eat it?"

"For what more junk food?"

Duke shook his head.  "You'll be surprised what someone will sell there time for?"

"You mean I could buy more computer time with junk food?"

Duke nodded.  "Yes. If that's what you want to do with your new found fame."

I smelled Madison come into the room.  He hand slid to my should, "You have an appointment."

I sighed.  "My life sucks."  I stood up and followed Madison to a small room and sat down in the empty room.  "And they are late."  I hated when people were late.
