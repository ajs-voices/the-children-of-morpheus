# I Hate This Elevator

We walked into the AU building holding hands.  Dev headed for the elevator and my heart started to race as it always did.  We didn't even make it past Atlas before Dev stopped and looked at me with concern.  "Not only did you just shut off before that you were afraid."  He whispered.  "What's wrong?"

I shook my head.  "Nothing.  Afraid of heights."

Dev chuckled.  "You live in a skyscrapper."

"I take the stairs."

"How far up?"

"I wouldn't suggest you walking them if you need to get to work soon."  I said and started walking towards the elevator with Dev following behind still holding my hand.

We waited for the elevator with the rest of the people.  Dev's hand slipped around my waist as we stood in the small crowd that always formed at the base of the glass death traps.  Dev started humming in my ear as he pressed the front of his body against my side.

The doors swooshed open and people piled out and then we all got on.  The doors closed and the only thing I could smell was the countless smokers in the small enclosed space. The smell pulled and tore at memories inside my head and I closed my eyes.  Dev pulled me closer to him and I buried my face against his neck and breathed in only his soft clean citrus scent and he whispered in my ear.  "Now take it in but don't look down /
'Cause I'm on top of the world, 'ey / I'm on top of the world, 'ey / Waiting on this for a while now / Paying my dues to the dirt / I've been waiting to smile, 'ey."

I focused on his voice in my ear and his scent.  The calm enveloped me.  And I started to wonder about a lot of things in my life.  We still have too many floor to go before we had to get off.  I didn't want to think about why were two guys so easy to manipulate my emotions and my body.  Dev continued his soft song, "Been holding it in for a while, 'ey / Take it with me if I can / Been dreaming of this since a child /I'm on top of the world," while my thoughts ranged through the why's and how's of Sage and Dev.  And Dee.  This wasn't going to be just the three of us there was a fourth and I didn't even know her.  But I had reacted to her too.  Fuck.  What was going on?

We reached our floor and the elevator was almost empty when we got off, there was someone waiting for us to exit when we got there.  I didn't know the red head's name as we passed, she lived on the floor somewhere but she was a few years older than I was and I was horrible with names, but she recognized me, and frowned when she didn't recognize Dev but she didn't say anything.

Dev laughed as I was pulling my keys out of my pocket.  "She thinks you are cheating too."

"To normal people I would be.  They won't get it."  I said.  "They barely understand me and Sage, much less I am seeing two others on top of him."

"You okay now?"  He asked.

"I am.  Thank you." I pushed the door open, "Welcome to my humble abode."
