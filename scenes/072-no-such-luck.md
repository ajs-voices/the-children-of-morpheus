# No Such Luck

The remainder of the day I tried to find Levi but no one knew where he was.  I couldn't get anything from the Archives while in the ward.  They frowned upon doing work and they frowned upon doing anything productive.  I was going to go fucking crazy.  After computer time we had an hour to our selves where everyone gathered in the common room.  It was annoying.  The only up side had been Jo sat in my lap.

Now if any other girl had sat in my lap without prompting I would have thought something was up.  But she was a wolf.  She was lost without her family.  I was pretty sure that whatever pack magic I had had taken hold of her and she was part of my pack.  Whatever that meant.  I didn't do anything.  But I hadn't done anything with Drake, or Matt either.  I just wanted to take care of them, and that was pretty much what was going on with Jo.  I don't even think she realized what she was doing.

Lori had giggled and sat next to us the next time we were in the common room.  We had arts and crafts after lunch.  I got another of those stupid pills.  I needed a goddamned computer and my anxiety was shooting through the roof.  To which Jo promptly came to sit in my lap again to comfort me.

No Levi.  No reseach.  No phone calls.  I was looking forward to bed.  Maybe I'd get to see Dev.  I liked that thought, it kept me going through the rest of the pointless day.  I needed to do something and by the time we were sent to our rooms for the remainder of the day I was bouncing off the walls with anxiety.  Yoga didn't help.  I did pull ups and push ups in every possible way I could think of before they called for lights out.

I wasn't even tired as I laid down to sleep.  The only thing I wanted to do was see my loves. All of them, but only one of them walked my dreams.  I could only hope he would tonight.
