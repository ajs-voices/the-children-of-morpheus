# Long Run

I broke my rules.  I went for a run and I didn't follow the same path I always did.  I ran from Sage's apartment back to the AU building.  I ran the 55 flights of stairs twice before I went to the Night Life building.  I could have called Ant.  It was dusk now he should be awake.  But I didn't.  I didn't even grab a cup of coffee.  I ran to the edge of Dom's territory and thought about crossing over just to get into a fight.  I needed to blow off more steam and I really couldn't do that anyplace in public.

Instead I ran through Central Park.  I don't know how many miles I ran.  I could look, my phone would tell me.  I don't know how mny times my playlist ran through.  Sage had called me three times and I didn't answer.  Dev and Dee had both tried.  My phone was blinking rapidly for all the missed texts I had.  I don't know how long I was gone for, I didn't really fucking care at this point.

By the time I was back in Hell's Kitchen it was late.  The street lamps were sheding their putrid yellow light and I sat down on Sage's front stoop to catch my breath.  I sat there until my breath was normal and then some.  I heard the door open behind me and Sage came out.  I could smell the jasmine and lavender in the air before he sat down next to me pressing his leg against mine.  "What's wrong, Nox?"

I shook my head.  "Nothing's wrong Sage."

"Yes there is.  You took off without eating.  I thought we had plans tonight.  To your shields or something."  He said confused.

"I'm here, they are here.  Nothing's changed."  I said.

"Why did you go for a run?"  He pleaded with me.

"Because I was jealous.  Alright.  You've been fucking them both without me.  You were fucking Dee right under my nose."

"You said..."

"I know what I said."  I interrupted.  "I'm perfectly aware I'm being a hypocrit right now.  I said you could.  I shouldn't be jealous, yet I am.  What makes it worse Sage is that I had the chance to do the same thing today.  To sleep with Dev.  And I wanted to.  I would have if he hadn't stopped us."

"Why didn't you?"  He asked as he shifted away from me leaving a small gab between us.

"Dev said you weren't ready to share me when you weren't around."  I sighed, "But I think he said that because I had thought it."

I stood up.  "I'm tired.  I need a shower." I left Sage sitting on the front stoop and headed towards the bedroom to grab a shower.
