# I Need a Break
 
I hung up the phone and walked around the side of Sage’s house and knocked on the side door where my love was still working.  He called out, “It’s unlocked.”
 
I opened the door and shut it behind me before I put my hands on his shoulders and he looked up at me with a smile. “Hey, Nox.  What do I owe this pleasure?”
 
“I needed a break.  Venatori parents are a pain in the ass.  I think that no matter what their kids say they don’t care.  And when they are given proof that their kids were wrong they blame everyone but themselves.”
 
Sage frowned as he turned back and started typing again.  He said, “That’s how most people are, I don’t think it’s solely a Venatori thing.”
 
I sighed, “You are right, but at least there are other people the kid can go to that might believe them and find the answers in your world.”
 
Sage turned in his chair and pulled me down into his lap.  “You okay?”
 
I pressed my face to his neck and nodded,”I am now.”
 
He turned back in his chair and started typing again with one hand while the other played idly with my back.  I still froze when he did it but I relaxed almost immediately into his arms.
