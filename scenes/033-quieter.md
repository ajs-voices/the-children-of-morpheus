# Quieter

After a quick yoga routine I went upstairs to shower.  Dev's chest moved in his sleep cadance.  I stood in the doorway taking in the sight of another man in our bed.  A man my boyfriend had already slept with.  I sighed as I grabbed clean clothes and walked into the bathroom to take that shower I'd come up for.

Sage was usually asleep in the bed waiting on me to finish so he could do his thing.  But this morning he was already up.  I probably should have made him some coffee, but I figured there was a pot already on.  He'd been up awhile.  And might be up for a long while more.

My shower was quicker than usual, same with the hair and make up.  I choose two use two different blues this morning.  I'd had help from both blue eyed babes and I was more than happy to share their success.  Though I doubted either would care one way or the other.  It was a thing for me.

Dev had rolled towards the door when I exited but other than that gave no indication he was awake.  I opened the bedroom door and was going to slip out when Dev's voice startled me, "Mind if I take a shower pretty boy?"

I turned back to see Dev lounging against Sage's pillow and his hands behind his head.  I bit my bottom lip.  I'd very much like to be looking up at him like that from a very different angle.  The smirk on his face told me he'd read my thoughts.

"You are pretty easy to tempt.  And so loud."

"I'll try to be quieter."

Dev shook his head, "No.  I don't think it's you."

"What do you mean?"  I asked as I sat down on the edge of the bed.

"It's hard to explain."  I had a feeling it was not but that he didn't want to talk about it.  I leaned across the bed and kissed his lips softly.  "Thank you for your help last night.  And this morning.  And feel free to grab a shower, find something that fits, I'm sure one of us has something you can wear.  Breakfast will be ready in twenty."
