# Confronting My Demon

Garrett was talking with Dae'lin in her office.  I knocked and I paled when I saw the look on Garrett's face.  He waved for me to enter not that I had been waiting for his invitation.  Dae'lin's back was to me when I entered and when the door closed the windows went black.  Not the shades being pulled down, they turned black.  Dae'lin turned around and I saw dead dark eyes and I took a step backwards.  The door knob was stabbing into my backside and I couldn't breathe.  It wasn't magic, but fear.  Nothing but fear...

"So good of you to join us."  A voice said from Dae'lin's mouth, but it wasn't hers.  She reached for me and I cringed away from her but there was no where for me to go as her cold fingers traced along the tattoo and down my jawline.  "Fear never tasted so good from anyone else."

There was a flash of light and then several tentacles of air and fire were behind Dae'lin and I stared at them.  Dae'lin couldn't do that.  Dae'lin couldn't touch more than one element at a time, but this demon had possession of her, he could.  His fingers dug into my chin as he grabbed it and made me look at Dae'lin's dead eyes.  "What did you do?"

I felt a crushing pain around me as the demon beat at my shield on a plane I couldn't see.  It was like my heart was being crushed in my chest.  I couldn't breathe.  Darkness swept over me as I lost consciousness.

It had to be only two or three seconds as I gasped for breath and the demon was standing over me.  "It's stronger than before.  What did you do?"

Dae'lin's small hand flew across my cheek and I felt my teeth rattle in my head.  I could taste the blood blooming in my mouth.  The demon growled, "Oh the strength.  I could break you couldn't I boy."

Garrett put his hands on Dae'lin's shoulders and spoke, "Let me be your vessel.  I want nothing more than to do your bidding Morpheus.  Let me have him back."

Dae'lin looked up at him and he laughed.  "If I inhabit you, he will not stop and think about killing you.  This one, he loves.  He'll not hurt her."

I reached up in one quick motion and grabbed Dae'lin's throat and squeezed.  I didn't just use my hand.  I wrapped air around her neck and I put a bubble of air and sucked out the air from inside.

Dae'lin's hand flailed and she grabbed hold of Garrett and I watched as the demon passed through Dae'lin into Garrett.  Dae'lin fell into my arms and the demon in Garrett's body opened the door and started to run.  I dropped my patterns around Dae'lin and wrapped her in the elements quickly before I took off after Garrett.  He ran for the stairs and like an idiot he ran upstairs.  Why the fuck to the bad guys always run up.  There was nothing down.  He could get away.  Unless he didn't intend to get away.  Fuck!
