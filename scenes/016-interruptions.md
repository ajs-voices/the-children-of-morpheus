# Interrruptions

Matt was in the hall holding Drake and he and Fae were laughing.  I walked out and smiled.  "Hey guys."

"Daddy!" Drake called out.

I heard footsteps behind me.  I glanced behind me and saw Devin following me.  Matt frowned, "We were supposed to go to Mr. Viddens weren't we?"

"Sage's memory is shit, he forgot to tell you."  I shrugged, "But ya'll can stay for dinner, just go downstairs, and stay down there."

I pointed at Devin, "This is Devin.  Dee's in the kitchen.  Devin."

He interrupted me, "Dev."

I grinned at him.  "Dev, this is Matt, holding Drake and the shy one back there is Fae. These are my boys."

Sage called out from the kitchen, "They're mine to Nox."

Matt laughed, "We are all family.  Though my dad is getting annoyed at all the time I spend here.  Says it ain't right."

"If you need to spend less time we understand."  I said as I pulled my wallet out of my pocket.  "Buy pizza, be quiet and keep the other two downstairs."

Matt took the money I offered him and kissed my cheek before he went downstairs with Drake after ushering Fae downstairs.

I turned to see the bartender from Aspect staring at me with a smirk.  He laughed, "So now you remember me.  He likes you know know?"

I nodded. "I know.  I don't encourage him.  It's a crush."

Dev laughed, "It's not a crush.  He'd do anything for you.  It's not in love with you, at least not like that.  He's jealous of Drake and Fae because they are yours."

I smiled at Dev.  "He's mine, just not on paper."

"Sage neglected to tell us of the boys."  Dev said.  He walked over to me and pressed me up against the wall.  "They are in there discussing the merits of your cooking.  We should join them."

I pressed a kiss to his lips.  "Yeah, we should."  I stared into his baby blue eyes and smiled.  "You're a telepath?"

He nodded.  "Didn't take you long to figure it out."

"You keep poking around in my head, course I'm going to notice."  I grinned.  "You see anything fun in there."

Dev smiled.  "I don't dig. Let's go eat."  He took my hand and pulled me into the kitchen.
