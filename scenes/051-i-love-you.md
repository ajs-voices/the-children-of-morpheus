# I Love You

I left Dorian sitting on the couch flipping through stations again.  Sage was sitting at his computer in his basement office busily typing away at his computer.  I stood behind him and watched for a little while.  I placed my hands on his shoulders and pressed my thumbs into his tense muscles.  "You work too hard."

He groaned before he anwsered me lolling his head back between my hands and looking up at me.  "I'm stressed over you."

I sighed.  "I'm sorry, love."

He turned around and pulled me into his down into his lap.  "It's alright, Nox.  You killed that thing with your power.  I knew what happened, but when you had done it before it was nothing like this."

I dropped my eyes.  "I got carried away.  When I was aware of what I'd done my body retaliated.  It was on fire.  And then there was you and Dev and Dee around me and I was okay again."

"You like him don't you?"  Sage asked me.  He didn't make me meet his eyes, but I looked up to see him frowning and looking down as well.

"I like him a lot."

"You'll leave me for him."  He said quietly.

"I'm not going anywhere, Sage."  I didn't know how to tell him.

"I'm not what you need, he is.  I see it."  Sage looked up.  "I'm okay with that.  That you love him.  I know you love me."

"I do love you.  I haredly know Dev.  But you are right, I do have feelings for him, maybe not love yet, but it's possible."

Sage gave me a wry grin, "Back when you were talking to Margo, we talked too.  Told her that I didn't think I could be what you needed me to be.  I can't be the man you need.  But I can't see see a life without your smile or your cooking in my life."  He grinned playfully at me.  "I don't need to be everything.  Dev and Dee can fill in the gaps.  I grew up knowing that my life was different from others.  I grew up thinking I was never going to be enough.  Turns out I don't need to be.  I just need to be me right?"

I nodded.  "I love you Nox.  And if I made you upset with Dee and Dev I'm sorry."

"I wasn't angry.  I was angry that I was jealous.  That you were sleeping with her and Dev and I were being good.  I need you to say it Sage.  Like so many other things I need need to hear the words."

Sage pulled me down for a kiss.  His tongue slipped into my mouth and we both hummed against each other.  When we parted Sage pressed my forehead against his.  "Nox, you can sleep with Dev and/or Dee without me present."  He pulled back and smiled.  "I know we said it was for watching you, but with them, I know you won't leave us.  You won't take Drake and Fae from me, you won't keep Matt from coming here.  I know that with them, we'll be happy.  Maybe one day we can all live together, all seven of us."

I laughed, "That sounds like a really big apartment we'd have to have."

Sage nodded. "One day.  Some day."  He kissed me.  "I have to get back to work.  You going to the AU building?"

I nodded.  "I am.  I'll bring all the boys back with me.  We might be doing a family sleep over for a few nights."

Sage grinned.  "That's fine with me.  I like puppy piles."

"Me too."  I kissed him.  "Me too."
