# Nightmare

My eyes shot open and I was sitting upright.  There was no doubt in my mind that it was Drake who had screamed downstairs so far from us.  I was out of bed and hadn't cared if I tore the blankets from my lovers.  I was down the stairs in almost one giant leap.  Around the banister and knocked over the glass bowl I used to keep my keys in as I rushed towards the basement door.  I pulled it so hard it smacked against the wall and left a hole in the dry wall but I hardly notices as I rushed down the stairs careful not to smack my head against the low hanging ceiling.

Down the hall into the spare bedroom I found my boys with a thing - a creature of blackness. It dripped and oozed like the veins of my shield had.  It's eyes were red and I froze.  They glowed in it's head like my dream come to life.

It laughed at me, it's jagged teeth dripping red.  A fine line of blood shown on Drake's neck and I wove a tight pattern of air and flung it at the creature.  It hissed as the air made it fly towards the far wall dropping Drake on the bed as it was plastered to the wall unable to move.

Fae's eyes were golden and his teeth were bared.  His hands were elongated and his hair shaggier than usual.  He was shifting from adrelaline and I had a scared Dragon crying.  It was all danger, so much danger but I loved these boys and the black creature had hurt them.  I used all the elements and I crushed the creature much like I had the orb on the dream plane.  It didn't shatter or crumble.  It squished and oozed and screamed a horrible scream as I sucked the air from its lungs, buried it alive in an orb of air while buring and drowning it all from the inside out.  I didn't wish that death on anyone - but this thing had hurt my boys.

The screaming had stopped but my fury did not. It continued until there was a hand on my shoulder.  I blinked to see Faelen was his self.  Drake was healed and happily sleeping in Dee's arms.  Sage was sitting with Fae petting his head in his lap.  Dev's hand was on my shoulder.  "You can stop now."

I looked at the orb in front of me and I dropped it in the waste bin.  It was nothing but goo, there was nothing solid left of the creature.  And then I collapsed to the floor.
