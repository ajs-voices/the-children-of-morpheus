# Breakfast

Making pancakes was time consuming so when Dev made his way down the stairs I hadn't barely started the eggs, but there was a pile of pancakes sitting on the island waiting for everyone to eat.  But he didn't sit down, he came up next to me and poured himself a cup of coffee.  "I'd take it black but then I might not drink it and it smells too good not to drink.  Milk or cream?"

"On the door in the fridge.  Sage likes it with cream and sugar so it's always on hand."  I said letting Dev help himself.  "While you are in there grab the syrup and mascerated berries in the white bowl, please?"

"You got it."  He said with a grin.  "I think the boys were stirring upstairs."

I nodded, "Yeah, Fae gets himself and Drake up then they get ready for school."

Dev put the syrup and berries on the island and sat down.  "Damn it all smells so good.  I knew you could cook but you do this every morning?"

Fae came in with Drake racing in before him to climb up next to Dev.  "Daddy, cooks every morning.  And every night."  He said.

Dev grinned at Drake. "Do you like his food?"

Drake shook his head.  "Not all the time.  Sometimes he makes me it green things.  I'm a dragon.  I'm supposed to eat meat!"

Dev laughed, "But you need to eat your green things or you won't grow up big and strong like your Daddy."

Fae sat down next to Drake and made his plate in silence.  Dev chuckled, "You don't talk much do you Faelen?"

He shook his head and mumbled, "No sir."

"Are they all yes and no sir?"  Dev asked me with a curious look.

I shook my head.  "No.  Fae grew up in a strict pack.  You spoke when you were spoken to, you eat after your elders, what your pack leader says is law no questions asked.  He's learning I'm not quite such a strict pack leader."

Faelen laughed, "Sage has less rules than Nox."

Dev grinned at Faelen I knew he wanted to say something sarcastic I could see it on his face.  But he behaved himself.  "What rules does Nox have?"

Drake giggled, "Clean your room. Eat your vegetables."  His face squinched up into a cute little version of ew before he went on. "Put things where they belong.  Pick up your clothes.  Shoes don't go in the middle of the floor."

Dev laughed.  "Is he a neat freak?"  Dev asked the little dragon.

Drake frowned as he shook his head.  "No.  It makes him hide."

"Hide?"  Dev asked around a forkful of pancakes and syrup.

Faelen nodded.  "Nox will go into their bedroom and lock the door if there is a mess in our rooms.  Sage says it's cause he can't deal."  He looked up at me, "But says he's not mad at us.  Just can't deal with the mess."

Dev smiled at me.  "What other rules you got?"

"I'll tell you them all sometime."

"All?"  Dev asked.  "You have a list of rules?"

I shrugged and Sage came up stairs chatting on the phone with his dad.  He said into the phone, "Gotta go Danny, Nox is done cooking and everyone's eating but me.  It'll all be gone." He was frowing at the near empty island of food.

I pointed at the stove where I had a plate stacked high with pancakes and bacon and eggs just for Sage.  He sighed with relief as he put his phone in his back pocket and picked up his plate and brought it to the island next to me.  Dev was in his seat and he didn't bother pulling the other stools out from their hiding spot around the corner.  He took a bite and moaned, "Damn.  Nox.  What you do different?"

I shrugged.  "Not much, a little more sugar and vanilla this go round."

Sage pressed a syrupy kiss to my cheek and I groaned.  "These are perfect.  No more chages."

Dev laughed.  "I do have to agree.  These are perfect.  Fluffy, and sweet and I'd almost say heaven."

I felt heat rising in my cheeks and ducked my head.  It was one thing to give me an out and out compliment, this was different.

We all ate breakfast in pleasant company.
