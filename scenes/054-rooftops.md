# Rooftops

Garrett was hardly in shape, but he was Venatori and the demon carried his body to the roof ahead of of me without a problem.  The door swung wide and scraped against the ground in the wind.  The sun was bright but it was cool up here on the top of the AU building.

The demon's eyes were glowing red when he looked at me.  He laughed.  "I'd prefer not to die," it said to me.

"So why did you run up?"  I asked.  It was such a stupid move.

It laughed.  "I have a plan.  And you have a choice to make.  You can save the man who tormented you your whole life or you can let him die."

I frowned.  "What do you mean?"

"No more talking, boy.  I will have you back and the others too.  I will have you."  The last words were said as he stepped up on the ledge of the roof.  He turned to face me and the smile was dark and made me shudder with fear.  I couldn't help it I wanted to close my eyes and make it all go away.  The demon took a step back and  I watched as it left Garrett in a black mist just as his weight carried him backwards.

I was standing on the precipice of a decision.  I had to make a decision.  A split second decision.  There were eight seconds to the bottom, even one second delay could mean death.  I didn't think.  It wasn't because I liked the man, but I could see the fear in Garrett's eyes as he realized what had happened.  I cleared the distance to the edge at a run and dove over the edge.  One... I spearheaded my way down to Garrett I moved past him and flipped on to my back.   Two... I wove air around us and I felt my body catch against the thickening air.  Three... I sent weaves to soften the earth below earth and water to make sure it was as soft as it could be.  Four...  Garrett's body collided with mine and I wrapped my arms and legs around him and spread my weaves tighter and thicker than I had before.   Five... I didn't want to die saving this bastard.  But I couldn't let him die either without trying.   Six... He deserved to die, but not like that.  He deserved to be brought to justice, but this wasn't justice.  I was the better man.  Seven .... I was the man he made me and I would forever be grateful even to my dying day.

Eight... I felt my body collide with the earth below and I felt the bones shatter.  There was no pain... there was nothing but blackness...
