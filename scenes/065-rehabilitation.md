# Rehabilitation

We all chatted, well mostly I talked, they asked questions.  They probably knew my whole life's story in that one sitting.  Seems the new guy always got grilled.  But it didn't feel like that.  But then again I was used to spilling my guts  with everything.  It tended to just fall out.

I didn't learn anything new about Jo, or anyone else.  Cliff's Amelia sat in my lap.  It was an enjoyable conversation I had with myself and Cliff.  He even helped me to my room.  Amelia stayed behind said she was going to watch my back.  I wasn't exactly sure why that was but since I couldn't see her I doubted whatever she wanted to protect me from I could see either.  I did wonder if Cliff was crazy or not.  Or if he really did see ghosts.  Hell of a gift to be a medium and then everyone disbeleive you and call you crazy.

I tried to stand and walk and all I managed was to sink to my knees.  Crawling would have to do I wasn't about to scream for assistance.  I should have gone to sleep but without Sage or Dev I was actually a little afraid to do so.  Even here where I should be safe I didn't feel it.  I used a wisp of air to unfurl the yoga mat not to far from my bed.  I may not be able to stand yet but I was sure I could do some yoga to calm down and relax.

It wasn't lights out yet. And the longer it grew from dinner the more I found myself drifting into a drowsy state.  Whatever they had given me was making me tired.  But I powered through the sitting and kneeling yoga moves then  moved into some bodyweight exercises.  A pushup was difficult but I did manage it, without any real assistance.  My core was still relatively strong, just my legs.  And that was difficult without any standing.

But I wove air around me and I used that to assist.  I don't know why I didn't think of it earlier.  I didn't need assistance from anyone I could do it myself.

I heard a large shrill buzz and then a voice over the intercom, "Lights Out."  I'd spent at least three hours zoned out in Yoga.  That was unusual.  I would need to ask about that.  I didn't like this medication if I was going to lose time.

I laid down in my lumpy bed and wrapped the blankets around me.  I wrapped the elements around me to comfort me.  I could feel the warmth from my ability coursing through me.  I wished it was Sage or Dev.  I wondered to myself when Dee would fit that comfort bill, if she ever would.  I was pretty sure Dee wasn't going anywhere.

I closed my eyes and imagined the warmth around me was Dev.  I wanted to see Dev.  I needed to see him.  I wondered what kind of dream I'd have with him and his baby blue eyes and inky hair that I wanted to run my fingers through...
