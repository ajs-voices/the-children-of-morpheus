# What Now

Dee grabbed me by the hand and pulled me around the island.  "Let them clean up.  You cooked."

I looked back at Sage with Dev pressed up against him like they were lovers and I was jealous. But Dee was dragging me into the living room and said, "Sit."

I did.  Promptly, like it was an order.  Not exactly sure why my body responded but it didn't.  I sure wasn't going to submit to her.  I didn't know her.  But she smiled harmlessly at me and I grinned back.  "Sage has told us what he's looking for.  What we want to know is what you are looking for?"

I shrugged.  "I'm not looking for anything.  I want Sage to be happy.  He doesn't do one night stands so my typical go-to add a third doesn't work here.  So he's looking for partners."

"We know.  What do you want out of it?"  she asked with her hand on my knee.

"I am not looking for anything out of it."

She pulled her hand away from my knee and frowned, "So you'll just have sex with us.  Nothing more?"

I shrugged.  "Look Dee, I don't know what will happen if we have sex regularly.  I didn't exactly plan on falling in love with a voyeuer much less Sage.  I don't do relationships on a general basis.  We'll negotiate and then we'll see where it goes."

She smiled and put her hand back on my knee and ran it up my thigh sending shivers down my spine.  "My plans for the night are kind of shot since you have three young boys downstairs."

I grinned.  "That's Sage's fault not mine."

"So I understand."  Dev and Sage walked in to the living room.  Dev sat down on the other side of me and Sage sat in the arm chair facing us.  He had this smirk on his face that said he was happy.  Dee spoke, "Nox says we can negotiiate terms and see where it goes."
