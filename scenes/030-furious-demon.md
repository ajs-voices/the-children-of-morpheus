# Furious Demon

Sleep came but it was interrupted by a phone call.  Sage answered and I barely heard anything.  But I felt him uncurl from me and kiss my cheek, "I have to go to work.  There is an emergency."

I mummbled something but even I didn't understand it as I drifted back to sleep.  The warmth of my bed lessened.  The smell of Sage faded and the darkness overwhelmed me.

The darkness was thick.  The fog rolled in and I could feel it against my limbs.  It was cold and wet and when it envloped my face it was suffocating.  I choked on the fog.  The red glow came from the east and grew brighter.  My heart was racing, my palms were sweating.  I was frozen in place.

The voice echoed in the darkness, "You have been a bad boy."

There was no warning when the first lash hit. I screamed.  It burned, it radiated through my body.

The blows landing without pause.  One after the other my skin tore from my body.  My throat was raw.

I felt a hand on my shoulder.  It pulled me into the light.  I saw a familiar face and he kissed me and whispered, "Wake up pretty boy."

I opened my eyes and I felt my body stuck to the sheets of our bed, but Sage wasn't here.  Where was Sage?

I reached for my phone and texted Sage.  "I need you up here."

I tried to sit up and I couldn't my body felt broken.  I wrapped myself in the elements and hoped it helped.  My phone rang and I picked it up and looked at the number but didn't recognize it.  I answered it anyway.  "What time is it?"

"Nox?  Are you alright?"

I blinked at the phone.  And Sage came into the room and he was typing on his phone, "What..."  He looked at the bed and rushed over.

I asked, "Dev?"

"Are you alright?"

Sage took the phone.  "Dev, no he's not okay.  How did you know to call?  Can I ask a favor I know it's late."

"Yeah, I just got in, was resting my eyes and felt his fear.  What do you need Sage?"

"Can you come help him?  It's a mess and I really can't.  There's a hacker group trying to get into one of our systems and I need to work."  Sage had moved into the bathroom to get a towel.

I heard Dev on the other end of the phone agree, and said he'd be over soon.  I tried to sit up again and Sage was pushing me back, "Nox, you aren't healed yet.  Don't move.  Dev, will come help but I'm not going anywhere till he gets here."

"I'll be okay.  I don't want him to see me like this."  I said.

Sage kissed me.  "Nox.  He'll see you like this one day if I have my way so he might as well know alright. What happened?"

I sat up with his help.  "I don't know.  You left, I had a nightmare.  Worst than I ever had before."

There was a knock at the door.  "Dev's here." I said.

Sage grinned, "You're hearing is handy sometimes.  I'll go let him in.  You okay?"

"I hurt but yeah I'm fine."

Sage pressed his lips to mine.  "I'll be right back."
