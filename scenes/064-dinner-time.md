# Dinner Time

Duke helped me to the dining room.  It was far nicer than the cafeteria was in te common area of the AU building.  The tables were round and white linen table clothes each seat with five place settings.  The chairs were all padded and nice.  It almost looked like we were in some posh restaurant.  I wondered if the food here was any good.

Duke sat me down in a chair then sat across from me with a white toothy grin.  "Cliff is going to be angry you are sitting in Amelia's chair."

I laughed.  "She can sit in my lap.  I won't mind - honest."

Duke shook his head.  "A little horn dog aren't you?"

"Yes."  I nodded.  "Very much so.  And I haven't gotten any in two weeks."

"The shock of it."  A familiar voice sounded.  "I'm sure it has nothing to do with the fact that you've been in a coma for two weeks."

"None at all."  I grinned at Madison as she set a paper cup and pills down in front of me.

I looked up at her and frowned, "What's this?"

"Your medication."

"I don't need medication.  None of that shit works on me."  I said with venom in my voice.  Margo had tried years upon years ago to give me drugs for my issues.  But my body burned off the human doses for the same conditions and the Venatori metabolism can't handle those drugs and I saw things when I had Venatori medication.  Not a pleasant situation either which way.

"Dr. Eriksen and Dr. Watson beleive it is for the best.  You need to take them.  Everyone takes their medication."

Duke frowned.  "It's better just to do it.  I'll make sure they don't do anything inappropriate if you have an unfavorable reaction."

I looked up at Madison and frowned.  "Fine."  I took the pills and downed them without water.  I felt a slight constriction in my throat as they passed and then there was nothing like I'd imagined the slight I can't breath moment.  "If I get loopy I will not be held responsible for my actions."

Madison nodded the purple strand falling in front of her face.  "I understand Nox.  Food will be on the way when everyone else gets here."

Lori and Jo filed in next, both taking a between Duke and myself.  Jo sat next to me.  She didn't look up and she kept her hands to herself.  I turned in my chair towards her and put my hand on her knee.  She jumped at my touch and I pulled my hand back just as quick.  There had been a sharp jolt when we touched.  I could smell the damp musty smell of forest undergrowth and then it was gone on the currents of the wind. I reached across the way and touched Jo's chin and there was a sharp zap and she looked up at me with fear.  "I'm sorry about that."  I said but I didn't let go this time.

Her eyes dropped to my hand but she didn't bow her head again.  "Why are you here?"

Lori interrupted, "It's not nice to ask that."

I frowned.  "I'm sorry but I need to know."

Duke's voice was low and gruff in a whisper and it sent a shiver down my spine. This was a man who could break me in half yet I was certain he was just a soft cuddly man who wouldn't hurt a fly.  "Jo's in for violent tendancies."

Lori sighed.  "She was found in a mall tearing apart the dressing rooms.  She was so strong, and so violent the Venatori stepped in.  But she's not one of us."

I shook my head, "She's a wolf."

"How do you know?"  Lori asked as she edge the chair a little bit away from Jo.

I pulled Jo's chair towards me and touched her knee.  "It's okay."  I looked at Lori and smiled.  "I just know."

"How long has she been here?"  I asked.

"A few months."

"Good."  I tried to stand up but fell back to my seat when my knees buckled.  "Fuck!" I whispered to myself.  I was going to have to do something about this soon rather than later.  I couldn't stand not moving under my own power when I wanted.

Dinner arrived before I could figure out what to do.  Cliff had arrived only moments before the plates were set in front of us.  No one had the same thing, my plate looked the blandest of them all.  Chicken and vegetables and a dinky little roll.

Lori giggled.  "We'll get your list to the cooks and you can have what we want."  She dug into her pancakes piled high and topped with strawberries.

I looked around and saw most everyone was eating burgers or pizza or any various other things.  This was some place.  Almost literally a restaruant for the crazy.  I wondered who did all the cooking and if I could help...
