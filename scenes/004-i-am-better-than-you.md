# Iâ€™m Better Than You
I stalked over to Garrett and for the first time in my entire life I didn't feel like I was five in his presence.  I felt like the man I had become because of him.  Because of the things he did to me.  I wasn't weak.  I wasn't a doormat.  I wasn't some fucking toy.  I stopped a foot from the man who I despised with every fiber of my being.  
 
And for the first time in his entire life Garrett stared back at me with fear.  I took a deep breath and had to take a step back.  My anger was racing around me, I could see fire spinning waiting to be unleashed.  I felt the heat of the room rising.  I took another step back and focused on the connections around me.  I thought about Drake and how he would never have a person like this in his life.  I wouldn't let anyone hurt Faelen ever again.  I would help Matt discover his true talent.  But most of all I focused on all those I loved.  I had people in my life. 
 
I sneered at Garrett.  "You won't take them from me."
 
I took a step back and released Garrett from the net of air and he fell to the floor in heap.  "I recorded your attack on me.  I recorded the fear Sam has for you.  But more importantly I recorded you hurting that little girl.  You will never touch another kid again.  If I find you near any child I will put a bullet in your brain faster than you can say my name.  And it is with in my right as Venatori to take the life of someone who harms his own by the Clandestine Providence.  You do not fucking hurt children!"
 
I turned around and walked quickly out the room and left the orange door wide open as I turned and went up into the observation room and knocked on the door.  "Sam let me in."
 
The door quickly unlatched and two sets of arms wrapped around me and I sank to the ground and pulled them both into my arms.  "He won't touch you again."  They cried and I cried with them.  "No one was going to hurt them again.  I would make sure of it."
