# Forging Bonds

We went into the room. I  didn't even ask Sage how he'd done what he did.  I wouldn't have understood anyway.  There was a large lump in the bed hands and feet were strapped to the sides.  It looked like torture.  The figure was sleeping but you could see him struggling against his bonds.  Dev gasped and almost collapsed to the ground but Sage was there and caught him.  They both sank to the ground.  Dev's voice was distant and weak, "Fuck me."

I was torn between going to Dev and trying to help Levi.  I needed Dev to help the boy so he won out.  I was down next to Dev.  He was pale and his blue eyes were fading fast.  I ran my fingers over his jawline and smiled at him.  "How can we help?"

There as a simple thought in my head.  It wasn't mine but it wasn't words either just a vague image of how we could help.  How I could help.  Sage held Dev, cradled him in his long arms and when I stood up I smiled down at them.  My two blue eyed loves.  Fuck I'd fallen fast.  I was so screwed.

But I didn't have time to deal with my problems.  I had a boy who was overpowering my rockstar with fear.  I'd done it before.  Taken a kid under my protection.  And that was what Dev wanted me to do.  I pulled at the pack magic inside of me.  I could feel it hum in my head and Sage gasped behind me as I pulled the magic around me.  I stole a glance at him and his head was bowed, his body protectively covering Dev but he had submitted to the power.  Shit!

I needed to understand this better - but another problem for later.  I wrapped that power around the boy.  I called his name and felt the pack protect him.  I could feel the fear radiating down the vine inside of us.  The thing that bound us all together, a living breathing rope.  It was pack.  It was nature.  It was one with the world.

The power floated around me, through me.  How did this work?  There were voices but I couldn't make them out.  I didn't understand them.  I sighed.

There was a hand at the small of my back and then another was around me from the other side.  I felt more than knew Dev was using his power.  I could feel him through the bond, he was looking around Levi's dreams.  He was awake and standing and I was confused.  Dream walkers didn't need to be asleep to walk that plane.  Garrett never had been.  I gasped and Sage squeezed my hip.  He was there.  I could feel his power flickering around us.  I really didn't know what was going on.  Dev sent reassuring mental images.  He was tired, and growing more so with each passing second.  I wrapped my arms around him and I felt him sink into me - physcially and mentally.  Sage grew closer, it was like we were one.

Fuck!  The singular word echoed through us.  I don't know who said it or if we all did.

And as quickly as the moment had come the power collapsed leaving the three of us leaning against the others for support.
