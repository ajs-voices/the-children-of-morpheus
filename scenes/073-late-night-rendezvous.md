# Late Night Rendezvous

This was the first time I'd gone to sleep willingly wanting to fall asleep immediately. I wasn't tired, I was far from tired.  I was excited.  Excited to see Dev.  And that was just the possibility of it.  But I closed my eyes and pictured Dev lying next to me and the stars on my ceiling.  I counted them and thought of Dev as the darkness came.  My blue eyed boys were both curled around me in the darkness.  I could smell the citrus and lavender mixing together and they weren't even in the room.

I must have drifted because when I opened my eyes I was under the tree again - alone.  But I could smell citris and lavendar on the wind as it blew through the barren braches.  The images flickered like a television set needing rabbit ears adjusted.  Shifting and phasing in and out of existance.

I walked away from the tree towards the horizon.  It was perfect and yet so bizarre.  The sun and the stars, the moon and the clouds.  A path of green grass lead to the tree and all around it was green where before only brown overturned soil had been. There was a hand at the small of my back.  I smiled.  "I hoped you'd come."

Dev smiled.  "I can't stay long pretty boy.  But I could feel you calling me.  I've got to work in an hour."

"So I'll say what I need too before you go and then we can spend the rest of doing whatever."

Dev took my hands and pulled me against him sliding his hands around my waist, "Do whatever huh?"

I grinned and pressed a chaste kiss to his lips.  "Business first.  Did you ask Sage and Dorian what I told you last night?"

Dev nodded.  "Yeah.  I called both of them when I woke up. They weren't happy with me."

"Good.  I need help getting information.  Can you ask Sage or Dorian to come visit me?"  I asked Dev in a low whisper.

Dev chuckled.  "You can't ask him yourself?"

I sighed.  "I don't get phone calls.  I can't check my email.  I have to go through my therapist and I'd rather not tell Margo my theories right now."

"I'll ask him."  Dev sighed, "Time flows differently here.  I don't know how much time we have."

I pressed my lips to his and whispered against them.  "Then we shouldn't waste it talking anymore."

Dev laughed and pulled me down on top of him.  The world shifted around us we weren't outside.  I didn't know where we were but I didn't care as Dev pressed his body up against me.  His fingers gripped my hair as he pulled me closer to kiss harder and deeper.  I ground against him.  Dev groaned against me when there was a faint beeping in the distance.


I sighed.  "One day we'll get to finish this."

Dev grinned.  "One day pretty boy."  He kissed me hard and while we kissing the world shifted again and I was back in my room alone.  But the scent of lavendar and citrus lingered as I let myself drift into the darkness.
