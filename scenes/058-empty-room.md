# Empty Room

Dee sighed, "I should go.  I need to grab a shower before work."

I rolled back to lay on my back and looked at her.  Her green eyes still catching the light and I saw the golden flecks.  "Look I'm sorry.  I'm an asshole sometimes."

"You don't need to apologize, Nox.  You are right.  I'm inclined to beleive the medical professionals.  I don't know you.  But I think I speak for the boys too, that they are worried about you."

"I know.  And I'll do this for the three of you.  But I'm not suicidal.  I'm too egotistical to want to rid the world of my charm and wit."  I grinned at her.

"You sound like Dev."

"Maybe that's why we like each other."  I said.

"Sounds like a way to clash to the high heavens to me.  But he likes you too."  Dee smiled and pressed a kiss to my lips.  "I like you too.  I'll speak with Madison later and see when we can visit you.  I'll bring you some real food."

I nodded as my stomach growled in response to food.  Dee laughed.  "You have to wait until the doctor says you can eat."  She pressed another kiss to my lips and slid her tongue into my mouth.  She tasted like old bitter coffee but my body reacted to the soft scent of roses and the light touch of her breasts against my chest.  She grinned down at me, "Dev's right, you are so easy."

I rolled my eyes.  "Only for you."

"A collective you?"  She asked, "That's what Dev says right?"

"Yes."  I laughed.  "Only for the three of you."

Dee pressed her lips to my cheek and whispered into my ear.  "I'd very much like to see how easy you are.  How you well you obey so I can punish you."  My body reacted and I had to shift to be comfortable.  Dee just watched me and grinned.  "So easy."  She leaned down and whispered in my ear, "No touching unless one of the three of us is present."

I groaned, "Yes ma'am."

She left me with another kiss and then I was left in an empty room with only my hard on and the beeping monitors to keep me company.
