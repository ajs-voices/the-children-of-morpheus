# My Studio

Dev walked in and looked around.  "This is all you have?"

"I told you I don't have much."  I went around the counter and bar into the kitchen.  "Coffee or water?  it's all I have here."

Dev laughed, "Coffee is fine."  He walked around the apartment.  He opened the closet and scoffed.   He closed it and went through the drawers.  "Sage says you haven't moved in, yet there is nothing here."

I shrugged.  "He doesn't want the place to exist.  He thinks because I still have it I don't think of his house as home.  But I do think of his place as home.  I only spend nights here when I have to be here early."

"Do you have nightmares here?"  Dev asked as he sat down on my bed and flopped backwards to stare at the ceiling.

"I have nightmares anytime I'm away from Sage." I pour two cups of coffee from the pot I'd been brewing while Dev wandered.  "Except when you spent the night, I didn't have nightmares then either."

"Why do you think that is?"  Dev asked as I sat down next to him and handed him a cup with cream and sugar.

"Sage make's me feel safe." My voice dropped into a whisper as I continued, "You make me feel safe.  And it scares me."

"Why does it scare you?"  Dev asked plucking my coffee from my hands.

"You just don't scare me.  Sage too." I confided.  Dev moved me backwards and straddled my legs.  It was uncomfortable sitting like that so I laid down.  Dev grinned at me and laid down on top of me.  His body weight pressing my into the mattress.

"So what about us scares you?"  Dev said above me, his lips a hairs breath above mine, his voice was filled with lust and desire and I could feel him through my clothes.

I grined up at him.  "It's hard to think with you like this."

Dev pressed harder into my body, letting his weight press me deeper into the mattress.  "So don't think.  Jutst talk to me."

I gasped for air and my eyes closed as I felt him against me.  My voice was a bare whisper.  "I'm afraid of losing myself in you.  Giving you everything without realizing it."

"And Sage?"  Dev breathed out across my skin and it sent shivers up my spine.  I gave a small moan and Dev reacted by pressing his hips harder against mine.

"It was a collective you."  I whispered.

Dev laughed against my neck as he kissed it.  His voice was rough with lust.  "I want to mark you.   But you aren't mine yet to mark."

"I am."

Dev rolled off of me and sighed as he stared up at the ceiling. "No Nox, not yet.  I don't think Sage is ready yet to share you alone with either of us.  We will honor his desire."

I nodded.  My body was cold and I ached for him, but he was right.  We didn't belong to each other.  We weren't a couple.  Hell we weren't anything.  Dating was only to get to know each other so it wasn't like fucking a stranger.  Sage didn't want that, no one night stands.  But Dev made me want more and Sage was pushing us together.  I knew this would end badly.

Dev rolled over and pressed a finger to my lips.  "Shhhh, Pretty boy.  This won't end badly."  He grabbed my chin with a gentle touch and turned me towards him.  "Sage is afraid of losing you.  You are afraid of losing him.  Slowly, Nox.  You fall to fast.  I barely touch you and I have you so easily in my grip.  You listen far easier to Dee than you want.  You say you don't want anything from us.  But your body does, your mind does.  Let's learn that before you condemn us all to a misery and desruction."  He pressed a soft kiss to my lips.  "I should go.  I think you need a cold showere."

I sighed.  "I don't mind waiting until I see Sage, lover."

Dev grinned and pressed anther kiss to my lips.  "I'll see you Friday when I pick up Sage?"

I nodded.  "I need to call Dee still."

Dev laughed.  "She says she'll be there with bells on."

"What's with you two and bells?"

Dev grinned as he kissed me long and hard.  He pulled away breathless and stood up.  I watched him walk to my front door and put his hand on the knob.  He smirked, "You are gorgeous like that.  I should make you stay that way all day.  Let Sage find you like this."

I groaned.  "Please don't.  I have work to do."

Dev laughed.  "Not today, but one day I will."  His smirk made his eyes sparkle.  "Tonight then, pretty boy."  And with that he left me alone on my bed wishing he hadn't been so honoroable.
