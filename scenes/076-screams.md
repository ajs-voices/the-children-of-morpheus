# Screams

I was going to become the guy who stormed out of therapy sessions it seemed.  I didn't want to be around people.  I wanted to go home.  This place sucked.  I headed towards my room but got distracted when I heard a faint scream of terror.  I stopped in the middle of the hallway and waited for it to sound again.  But it didn't, I must have imagined it.

But the moment I started walking the scream became plain as day.  It wasn't loud but the sound made me though of terror - of nightmares come to life.  I closed my eyes and I focused on the sound.  I wasn't the best tracker by sound, but I could do it.  And when I got close enough I could smell the fear.  But for now sound was all I had.

I took a few steps forwad and my eyes still closed, letting my hearing guide me.  Super human hearing had it's benefits.  No one ever snuck up on me unless they knew how to be extremely quiet.  But here every sound was distinct.  I heard a pen drop in the common room and the rustle of the persons clothes as they picked it up.

I could hear faint monitor beeping in some of the nearby rooms.  They had machines hooked up to patients, but that wasn't where I was heading.  I could hear snores from down the hall of someone catching a nap in a closet.  I should say something, but maybe I'd need leverage one day.  Though I wouldn't know who to blackmail if needed as I didn't go see.

I followed the faint screams and it grew louder.  I could smell the fear in the air and wondered why no one bothered to check on the boy inside.  I knew who it was before I got to the door.  It was locked from the outside and there was no way in.  But I needed to get inside.  The boy was afraid.  I could feel his fear.  It was thick in the air.  I shivered in the warm air.  His fear was that strong.

My ability didn't work with eletronic locks.  But I knew who's would.  I sighed and turned around to find my way back to my room.  Dev had worked last night, he might be home asleep or there soon.  Could I take a nap during the day?  I might if this boring routine kept up like this.
