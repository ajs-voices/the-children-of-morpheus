# Fouresome

The rest of the day was rather bland compared to morning.  Paperwork and boring things.  Though I called Dee and asked her out on Friday night.  I had run through the conversation so many times before I called her that when she answered and said she'd love to hang out with me on Friday I was a bit surprised and dumbfounded.  She'd said she was waiting for my call since Dev told her.  We didn't talk long, though she said we'd see each other later.  Dev had plans she said.  The way she said it made it sound like what it wasn't.  Dev was planning something dangerous not something sexy.  He wanted support.  I wasn't sure I wanted him to put himself at risk but as much as I hated to say it, he was a hero in his own right too.  Had to save someone if he could.  I didn't blame him, I was the same way.  I hated it about myself sometimes.  It was more trouble than it was worth.

But Sage and I planned dinner.  He was nervous.  He flittered about the kitchen while we waited.  The boys had pizza again and were downstairs hanging out.  It was just Fae and Drake, Matt couldn't get away on the weekdays.  We were lucky to have him on the weekends.  I trusted Fae with Drake, but Fae was more inclined to come upstairs when he knew he shouldn't.  He was a social creature.  And wolves disliked being a lone.  I think Fae needed a real pack, not mine little make shift one of people I was gathering around me. But he seemed content except when he had only Drake.

The doorbell rang and Sage jumped.  "I'll never get used to that," he said as he headed down the hall towards the front door.

I followed him to greet our guests.  Sage opened the door and presed himself up against the open door while Dee pulled in a large suitcase and Dev had a small backpack with his things.  I laughed, "Dee you planning on staying a while?"

She laughed but didn't say anything as she headed up towards the bedroom.  "I'll just put these in your room Sage?"

He nodded.  "Yeah.  You know the way."

I frowned but quickly hid the disappointment  behind the fake smile I wore in public.  Sage had slept with her in our bed - alone.  And I looked at Dev, he was watching his girlfriend go up the stairs.  I sighed and turned back towards the kitchen.  "Dinner will be ready soon."

I heard Sage and Dev exchange words and then the door closed.  Dev followed me into the kitchen.  Sage made a noisy exit up the stairs.  When Dev came into the kitchen he was empty handed, Sage must have taken his things up stairs.

Dev asked, "You alright?"

I shrugged.  "I'm fine," I snapped.

Dev sat down at the island, "That doesn't sound fine."

"You know they are fucking right?  Have been for a while."  I said.

"Of course they are."

"Are you sleeping with him too?"  I asked.  I know I sounded like a jealous boyfriend.  And I was.  My boyfriend was fucking someone else in our bed.  I was very much aware of how much of a hypocrit I sounded at the moment.  We had an open relationship.  My idea to keep Sage happy.  So he could explore and do and not leave me.  And now ... I sighed.

Dev looked at me, he hadn't answered my question.  "I've only had sex with Sage with Dee."

"So you and I can't, but they can.  Lovely."  I pulled out four plates from the cupboard and slammed the door closed in fustration.

I set the plates on the island and looked at Dev.  I shook my head.  "I need to go for a run."  I walked out of the kitchen and towards the stairs, but Dev caught my arm and stopped me.

"If you go up there right now you won't be happy."   Dev tried to pull me close to him but I stood my ground.

"I'm perfectly aware they are having sex right now.  I can hear them."  I yanked out of his grip and went upstairs anyway.  I opened the door and didn't look at the bed.  I didn't look at Sage's half naked body with Dee sitting on top of him.  Her hands rubbing his chest her, her skirt hitched up and his fingers pressing into her hips.  I didn't look.  I swear to fucking god I didn't want to look but I saw everything.  Smelt the familiar scent of sex in the air.  They looked at me as I rounded the corner and went into the closet to change into running clothes.

I came back out and they were still in the same position though they had stopped to watch me.  I didn't say anything as I headed down stairs in shorts and a t-shirt.  I grabbed my phone and keys and headed for the door.  Dev took my arm again - gentler this time.  He was frowning at me.  "Don't go like this."

"If I don't go like this I'll blow the fuck up Dev.  It's alright for them to fuck under our noses but we can't because Sage isn't ready to share me alone.  I beleive you when you say he's not ready.  If it's because you don't want to that's perfectly fine too, but I can't be here.  I thought he wanted to watch.  Seems he's more interested in women than me."

And I left without another word.
