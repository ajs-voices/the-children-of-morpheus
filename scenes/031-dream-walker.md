# Dream Walker

Sage walked into the bedroom with Dev on his heels as I stood up.

"Holy fuck!"  Dev exclaimed, "What the fuck happened? I thought that was just a dream."

Sage looked at him, "What was a dream?"  Sage was pressing me back down onto the sticky blood covered sheets.  "Nox, sit, your back isn't healed yet."

Dev looked at my back and his hand jerked back with blood.  "Fuck!" He looked at Sage, "I got it from here Deadshot."  He pressed a kiss to his lips and Sage blushed.  "Go do your hacking thing, I got our pretty poy."

Sage looked at me and then back to Dev, "You sure.  This is a lot."

Dev grinned at Sage.  "Deadshot, if you can handle this.  I can handle this."

"I'm okay, love.  I promise.  Dev can help me clean up."

Sage sighed then wrapped his arms around me and gave me a hug then a simple kiss on the check.  "Call me if you need me."

I nodded.  "Thanks love."

I watched Sage leave the bedroom.  He was immediately on his phone tapping away.  Dev turned back to me.  "That's a lot of blood for your back.  Let me help you take the shirt off."

I sighed and just sliced it off with a razor of air and Dev's eyes went wide.  "Same thing that does it is actually useful."

Dev put his hands on my shoulders and turned me.  "Your back is fine."

"I healed it."  I sighed.  I turned around and looked at all the blood on the bed.

Dev looked across the bed as we stripped the bed of blood soaked sheets.  "The mattress is ruined."

I shrugged not really.  "Its not the first time it's happened.  I've cleaned it before."  I wove some air with some earth and fire and the stain lifted right out.

Dev laughed, "You've done that before."

"A few times.  This is the worst it ever been though."  I said as I went out into the hall to get fresh sheets to make the bed with.

Dev helped me make the bed and I looked at the time on my phone it wasn't even midnight. "What did you do?"  I said as I laid down and pulled the sheets over me and patted the bed next to me.  "Can you stay?"

He looked at me then looked down the hall.  "You're boys?"

I pulled my pillow under my head and closed my eyes.  "I need to sleep.  I'm drained."  I grinned at him.  "Quite literally, sex is so far beyond me right now."

Dev laughed as he tugged off his shoes and jacket.  "I meant, what are they going to think if they find me in your bed?"

I shrugged.  "I'll tell you what Sage told me when I protested you seeing me like this.  If he gets his way they'll see it eventually."

"His way?"

I nodded.  "I think he intends this to go on a good long while.  I like the idea myself."

Dev pulled his jeans off and crawled into bed next to me.  "I've not spent the night in a guys bed in a long time."

"We'll you are only the second guy who's I've shared a bed with who wasn't my best friend without having sex."  I grinned at him.  "But next time we do this I think we'll be having sex before cuddling."

"You want to cuddle with me?"

"Yes, I want to.  I don't know what you did in my dream.  Maybe you can keep it away, maybe not but touch always helps with Sage when I'm having a particularly bad day."  I said as I moved closer to Dev.  He laid on his back and wrapped his arm around me and I froze when his hand touched my bare back.  My pulse was high and my palms were sweating and I could feel myself shaking against him.

Dev's fingers splayed across the scars on my back.  His voice was low I barely heard it at first, "This ain't a song for the broken-hearted / No silent prayer for the faith-departed." I focused on Dev's low voice, "I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd / You're gonna hear my voice / When I shout it out loud."

I calmed a little with each word he sang.  He hummed, "is it helping?"

I looked up at him and smiled.  "Never had a guy sing me to sleep before.  But yeah it helps.  What did you do, Dev?"

"When?" He asked.

"In my dream."

"Sometimes when I go to sleep, I sometimes find others dreams.  It's how I found Dee actually.  I felt fear.  I was drawn to here to your fear.  I didn't know it was you.  I saw a dark figure beating on a man, I didn't know it was you until I pulled you out.  I don't know how I do this it just happens."

"Normally I'd be freaking out about what you can do.  But I think that fear I dealt with finally. I don't know if you'll keep the nightmares away like Sage, but maybe if it happens again you can pull me back out."

Dev hummmed and picked up back singing, "It's my life / It's now or never / I ain't gonna live forever / I just want to live while I'm alive."

I smiled and pulled up closer to him and took a deep breath of his skin and smiled he smelled of mellow citrus.  I closed my eyes and tried to drift off to sleep as I listened to him sing me to sleep with his hand rubbing small circles along the scars of my back.
