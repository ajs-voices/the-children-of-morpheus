# Vampire Calls

My father was notorious for pissing me off.  Today was no different.  And it always seemed to be about the same things.  You are gay.  You aren't a horrible hunter.  You can't do this.  You can't do that.  He's always bitching about Dorian.  Dorian made you gay.  Dorian did this.  He didn't do that.  I sighed as I sat down at my desk and looked through the files my father had on the vampires.  It was not much to go on but I did give Ant a call.  But he wasn't the one who picked up.  "'ey Nox.  How goes it?"

I sighed.  "Ryan.  Ant around?"

"Nope.  He's sleeping.  Cari insisted he die this day."

I sighed.  "Alright.  I have to speak with him about some vamp killings around the city.  My dad's on the case and he thinks someone is trying to send a message.  I have the photos and things.  Maybe tonight or tomorrow we can get together and discuss it."

Ryan laughed.  "I'll have Ant get with you when he can.  He'll call you or something."

"Fine. Ryan.  Tell Cari I send my regards."

"She'll love to hear her pet Venatori says hello.  Adios!"  Ryan hung up and I let the phone die.

There was lots of work to do for other people and when my alarm went off I knew I was a litle late for my lunch with Dev, thankfully it was just across the street.  I sent Dev a text, "Lost track of time, on my way, be there in five."
