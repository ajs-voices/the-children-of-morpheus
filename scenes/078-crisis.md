# Crisis

I didn't really hear someone came in on a higher level, but when the cold hand touched my arm I jumped.  But I had heard them gasp and come in.  I had changed the pattern around me to avoid anyone else.  I heard a soft voice but the blood rushing through my ears and the fury in my blood was still making it hard to hear.  The fire popped out of existance with a low whine.

"Nox..." a soft voice said as I came back to the real world.  "You okay?"

I looked down at the hand on my arm and then up at the face attached to the arm and frowned.  My purpled haired first was looking back at me like she cared what happened to me.  My inability to answer prompted her to pull me towards the chair.  "Sit down."  She started fussing over my vitals and my eyes and I blinked at her.

"I'm fine.  I was just upset."

"You don't ever lose control."  She said as she continued to fuss over me.

"I didn't lose control.  I just got lost in it - on purpose."

"What's wrong?  Why?"  She asked as she knelt down in front of me looking up at me with a pair of purple tinted eyes I knew were blue.  What was it with blue eyes I found so attractive?   Where those visions why?

I sighed and shook my head.  "I felt played with, is all."

"Who would be stupid enough to play with you?  I mean other than Aaron and his goons."  She smiled up at me.

"The universe, fate, destiny, god.  You tell me."

Madison nodded.  "An excisential crisis?  I'm not qualified to help with that.  Maybe you should talk to your therapist about that."

I glared at her and Madison laughed, "Oh,kay then maybe not.  You sure you are alright, that fire was hot?"

I nodded.  "I'm fine."

She stood up and pressed her hand to my forehead.  "Alright.  You have visitors.  If you'd like they can come back here or you can visit with them in another room."

"Here is fine."  I said.

Madison smiled, "Okay.  I'll go get them."
