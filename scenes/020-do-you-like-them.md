# Do You Like Them?

Sage watched them walk down the street and around the corner before he closed the door.  I was already in the kitchen making sure things were in order so I didn't have a freak out later.  Sage came in chuckling, "Don't trust us?"

"Trust you just fine, just thought you might have gotten a little distracted with Dev here."  I quipped back.

"Do you like them, Nox?"  Sage pulled out a stool from under the island and sat down while he watched me putter around the kitchen not really doing much of anything.  It was a calming task for me.

"I hardly know them.  They were hot.  Cute together.  You obviously like them.  They like you."

"They like you too."  Sage grinned.  "Dee likes you that's for sure.  Dev's hard to read."

I shook my head, "He's a telepath, he probably is used to keeping his motives to himself."

"What?"  Sage sounded shocked.  He hadn't known?  "How do you know?"

I smiled, "He was reading my mind.  Commenting on things I never actually said out loud."  I leaned across the island and took Sage's hand in mine, "He's a high level one from what I can tell.  But I don't think he can broadcast his thoughts to others over a distance. You are safe."

"I..."  Sage stammered.

"You watch too many of those stupid sci-fi shows." I interrupted his denial.  "I know you Sage, you were thinking he could make you do things you didn't want."  I pulled a hand to my lips and kissed it gently.  "Trust me, you are safe.  I'm pretty sure he needs physical contact to pass along his thoughts.  So unless you've been doing things you don't normally do with Dev touching you don't worry about it."

Sage sighed.  "Your world is always interesting."

I laughed.  "They aren't my world.  You brought them here."

Sage frowned, "Yeah.  I didn't know he was supernatural."

"She is too.  Though it's all weird around her.  I can't figure it out."

"More of those things I can't see.  Patterns?"  Sage asked.

I nodded.  "Yeah.  It's hard to explain.  I don't even think I could try to someone who'd undstand what I said."

"Maybe Dorian can help?"  Sage suggested.

"It's not a big deal.  We'll figure it all out."

Sage let go of my hands and walked around the other side of the island and trapped me against it between his long arms.  "Am I neglecting you?"  he whispered against my neck before nuzzling close and kissing softly.

I shook my head and mummured, "No."  He had been seeing them often, but he had been taking care of me too.  I wasn't jealous of them.  Nor of the attraction they had for my boyfriend.  Sage wanted more than I could give him alone.  I was happy with all of that.
