# Takeout

I had a date.  And not with Sage.  When I walked into the house, I could smell Italian food being warmed in the oven.  Sage had ordered out.  I walked into the kitchen dropping my keys and phone in the dish by the door where I kept them.  There was an identical one upstairs in our bedroom.

Sage was hovering over the oven while we warmed the food.  I cleared my throat and he looked up at me.  "I ordered out."  He said as he went back to his watching the food warm.  He'd burnt one too many meals so he hovered now.

"I can smell it.  Why?  I would have made something."

Sage grinned at me.  "I wanted you to relax.  I'm sorry."  His grin had faded to a frown as he apologized to me.

I shrugged, "I'm okay.  Told you I needed a run."  I shook my head, "You'll never guess who I ran into on my run."

"Who?" he asked with a smile on his face.

"Dev."

Sage stood up and his grin returned.  "Where at?"

"Outside his building.  He had an early shift.  Why didn't you tell me I ran past their place everyday?"  I asked.

"I didn't think about it.  From the grin on your face it was a good adventure."

I smiled.  "We are going to have lunch tomorrow.  Me and him.  Get to know each other."

Sage smile and went back to his hovering over the food until the timer went off.  He reached for the oven mitts and opened the door to pull our dinner out.  The boys would be here soon.

I added while he set the hot dishes on pot holders.  "You don't mind?"

He shook his head.  "We have an open agreement right?"  I nodded and he smiled at me, "So why would I care.  You can see whoever you want."

"Sage, you know I don't want to see whoever I want."  I sighed, "I just want to see you."

Sage walked around and put his hand on me hips and pressed me up against the counter.  "And I want to watch you.  And you need to like them too don't you?"

I sighed and nodded then pressed a kiss to his lips.  "Yeah I guess.  But I'm only doing it for you."

Sage laughed, "No you aren't.  You like Dev.  I can see it.  He likes you too.  He told me."

"I kinda figured that out when he said he's been watching me run past his building for a while now."

Sage grinned.  "I'd forgotten about that.  I was there one day when you were on your scheduled run.  He went down stairs with a raspberry iced tea and waited for you to run past.  Dee said he could keep a clock by it.  That he knew when you were out of town too."

"Has he been spying on me?"  I asked.

Sage shook his head, "I don't think so.  You said he's a telepath, maybe your thoughts are that stray."

"They are." I sighed.  "I'm not sure I like that he knows that much about me."

Sage pressed his lips to mine.  "Yes you do, Nox.  You want someone to read that pretty little mind of yours.  Someone to know exactly what you need and want."

I cocked my head at him, "Is that why you are pushing Dev?  Because you think you can't live up to what I need."

Sage frowned, "I know I can't Nox.  You are like this enigma.  You tell me everything but I don't know how to deal with it.  I need help taking care of you.  I don't want you to leave me because I fail at the only thing you need from me."

"I don't need anything from you Sage.  Just you."  I sighed and pushed Sage away gently so I could leave.  "I need a shower."
