# Levi's Not Here

Dev and Sage sat down on the floor whatever energy they had expended had exhausted them.  I stood over Levi's bed and sent the elements through his body.  He had fallen still after we'd done what we did - whatever it was.  His face was relaxed.   The rhythm of his breathing was that of sleep.  I undid his restraints and helped his body heal from the wounds.

At that moment a rash of people flooded into the room.  "What are you doing here?"  Someone asked.  Dev and Sage were standing beside me in the next moment.

A burly orderly walked in and frowned at me.  "I knew you'd be trouble."

I grinned at him.  "I was just helping him.  I knew how.  I'm sorry."

One of the doctors came in and looked over at the boy.  "Why did you unrestrain him?"

"He doesn't need it anymore." I said.

The boy groaned and everyone in the room darted out except the doctor and us.  I looked at Dev and he smiled and took Sage's hand.  He'd heard my thought, 'get out just in case'

Sage looked back at me and I smiled at him with reassurance. "I'll be fine. Help Dev."

My boys left and I looked down at the boy.  He stared up at me and blinked.  And then there was nothing in his eyes.  Where a moment of recognition had been, there was nothing now.  The boy was not there.

The doctor was checking his vitals.  He kept looking at his pupils.  "We need to do some scans.  But whatever you did, he's not in pain anymore.  I don't think he'll ever be the way he was."  The doctor said.

The man looked at me and frowned.  "Thank you, but you should go now."

I nodded.  "You care for him don't you."

The man nodded.  "He's been under my care for 11 years."

I sighed.  "He came in when he was six?  Has he always been in bed?"

The doctor shook his head, "No.  He only got bad here recently.  A few weeks ago he fell into a coma.  It's not the first time he has but this one was by far the worse.  Whatever happens to him makes his condition worse."

"Can I ask what you think is wrong with him?"

"They boy was abused as a child.  He hurts himself, and his mind has never been right.  Claims to see things that aren't there.  He hears voices."

"I know I'm asking too much, but what does he see, what does he hear?"

The doctor frowned, "I'm sorry I can't tell you.  All I can say is none of it was real."

I doubted that very highly.  Everything he'd seen was real.  I beleived him even if he couldn't tell me.

The doctor escorted me out of the room and closed the door.  "I don't know how you got in there without a key but don't do it again."

I grinned at him and watched him leave.  Dev and Sage were sitting against the wall. I sat down next to Dev and pput my hand on his.  "So we are dreaming tonight, the three of us?"

Dev grinned, "We'll see if I can.  I am going to have to call in sick I think.  My fucking body hurts."

Sage smiled.  "I'll take you to my house, so you can sleep.  Drake and Fae can stay with Kai.  Dee can come by too."

Dev nodded.  "We'll see you later pretty boy?"

"In our dreams."  I grinned at him and leaned over to press a kiss to his lips.   I helped them both up and kissed Sage good-bye too.  I'd see my boys later... shit my life was getting more complicated each day.
