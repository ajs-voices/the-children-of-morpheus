# Waking Up

The light was blaring and white.  And the sound of beeping monitors echoed in my ears like blaring alarms.  I growled at the discomfort I was in.  My arms were immobile and so were my legs.  I struggled against whatever was holding me down.  I felt a hand touch my cheek and a soft voice sounded in my ear, "Nox, darling, calm down, it's alright.  You are safe.  Calm down and I'll unbind you."

I recognized the voice and did as she asked.  I smelled roses and felt her hands work the straps on my arms first.  I laid still completely waiting for her to unbind me.  She muttered to me "Shhh.  It's okay Nox."

I opened my eyes and blinked back the tears that stung them.  I watched Dee undo the bindings on my legs.  I tried to speak but I couldn't my mouth was dry.  Dee placed a few ice chips against my lips.  I asked, "What are you doing here?"

Dee smiled.  "I'm just visiting.  But I can manage this much."

"How long have I been out of it?"

Dee raised the bed so I was sitting up.  "A few days.  Your nurse says you should be dead."

"I've heard that before."  I sighed.  "The boys okay?"

Dee nodded as she sat down in the empty chair.  "They have been staying with Kai while Sage stays in your apartment.  Dev and I stop by and visit when we aren't working."

"How many days, Dee?"

A small girl came in and I saw the purple streak in her hair.  I recognized her of course, how could I forget Madison.  She took my vitals.  "You've been in a coma for two weeks while your body healed from crushed bones and internal bleeding.  You should have died from that jump Nox.  What ever possessed you to jump?"

I frowned, "And Garrett?"

"He died on impact.  We thought you were dead too until you gasped when we pulled his dead body from the top of yours."

"Walker said you could do amazing things, but I didn't think you could do it while you were dead."

"Was I dead?" I asked.

"No one really knows.  But you should have died Nox.  There was no way you should have survived with Garrett dead on top of you."

I sighed.  "When can I go?"

Madison laughed, "Your doctor needs to see you and I don't think you'll be going anywhere soon."

"We'll keep you company.  Even your father has stopped by."  Dee said.  "He's a nice man.  The boys love him."

"They do." I said.  "He loves them."

Madison spoke at the door, "Your doctor will come by soon and see you, until then don't move and drink very little."

I nodded.  "Yes, ma'am"
