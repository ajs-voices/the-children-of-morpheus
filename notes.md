Sage is eager for Nox to meet another couple he's been hanging with and the night they are introduced new information comes about Nox's metaphyscial shields and with the help of Dev they break the connection, but whatever was doing it attacks the boys staying upstairs in Sage's house.  With the link severed there is only one person who could have forged it, the same person who created the dreams to begin with, Nox goes to confront Garrett but the master is already confronting him and in an attempt to silence Garrett he jumps from a building and Nox follows.  Narrowly saving Garrett but injuring himself in the process Nox wakes up in the infirmary and soon finds he's being pressured into yet another suicide watch despite his and his father's protests.  While inside the pschye ward Nox is forced to meet with therapists including Dr. Margo Silverman who he hasn't seen since June that year, he also meets other residents one of which is an unchanged werewolf and a boy who has gone crazy who he recognizes as the boy in his dreams but Nox can't break through to him.  Sage brings their new friend to visitation under the guise of a therpaist and they help break the connection with the demon for Levi but the boy is too far gone and they have no choice but to leave them there, During his stay Dr. Amara Eriksen informs Nox of his presumed death and subsequent revival and their testings on him, Nox demands his release  but before hit can happen the second of the couple visits Nox.  That night his dreams become new and deadly as the fear demon inhabits Nox's dreams personally after hitching a ride on their friend which the demon insures Nox knows happened.

## Morpheus Story

Leads tens of thousands of spirits/demons called mara or nightmares.

Role: Antagonist
Race: Demon
Age: unknown
Physical body: unknown

### His Story

For millennia Morpheus has been corrupting children to do his bidding - of their own free will - by invading their dreams. He has many children, who help him connect to other children, his web of children is wide and vast and covers the globe. He feeds on these children's fear whether they be human or supernatural. But Morpheus has a hunger for supernatural fear he haunts their kind more often and sends his minions to do his work. Most children go crazy from his ministrations, a rare few fight him tooth and nail and become productive members of society. Those that fall in between bring Morpheus additional children to do his bidding. His favorite children are the ones that can bend all the elements. They have great fear, and great power to siphon off. Each of these elemental children have their very own maras watching over them for Morpheus. They are his favorites and they are all so easy to find, holed up in one place in New York City. Just ripe for the taking.

One of the most successful children Morpheus has captured in his dream claws has been Garrett Spencer. An empathic Venatori who didn’t go mad when and became a critical part of Morpheus’ plans to collect children and feed on their fears. Garrett has been the only child who was willing submitted his fears to Morpheus and the only child who does not have their own personal nightmare.

Garrett’s first attempt at bringing an elemental child to Morpheus worked but failed at the same time, the child proved to willful and disobedient, but he was full of fears and his nightmare easily manipulated him. But his willfulness never really went away. But the connection was strong and Morpheus endured the willfulness.

The second child with elemental went mad and his nightmare was locked away with the boy.

The rest of the elemental children were still young and feeding without a problem. With two new additions to his feedings Morpheus felt stronger than ever.

### One Sentence Summary

A fear demon begins to notice a drastic reduction in the fears coming from his children finding the cause and eliminating it becomes his top priority.

### Paragraph Summary

Morpheus’ children have always fed him and his nightmares well. A new set of elemental children have become distant, harder for his nightmares to reach and Morpheus begins to search for the reason why. He finds their souls protected by some unknown force, something new is on to him and Morpheus must find out what it is. The one thing that Morpheus didn’t expect was one of his own children to be fueling this unknown force, and connecting himself to each of them in some bizarre way. There is only one solution to this problem, to find a host and kill his own child.

## Sage Morgan's Story

Sage doesn't quite feel he's up to handle Nox all alone, he's been looking for others for multiple reasons and when he finds Devin and introduces him and his girlfriend to Nox things make a drastic change in both their dynamic and Sage's world at large.

Sage had been dating Dev and Dee on and off for a few weeks before he introduces them to Nox over dinner.  Dinner becomes a 'therapy' session among other things and danger enters his home for the first time since knowing Nox.  What should have caused a fight was overriden by the fact that Nox was critically injured days later and then sent into suicide watch and the only way Sage can get in to see Nox is if he's a doctor, so he fakes it with Devin who is also a telepath.  Inside Nox tells them about a boy who is like him and they break the demons hold on him but he's too far gone, but afterwards Nox is informed that he's been poisoned by the people here and demands release, but before he's released he falls into a coma and won't wake.  To keep himself busy Sage works on the card of information Nox gave him, and when he cracks it he goes to see Nox and tell him even though he's still asleep, but he notices a visible reaction when he's there, Sage asks Dev and Dee to come see what he did and together the three of them help Nox fight the demon who's put in into this state.  When he wakes up Sage tells Nox what he found, Nox being Nox makes a decision and accuses the Venatori publicly in an open forum, Sage and the others can do nothing more than watch as they drag him away and tie him down, drug him and change the tattoo on his temple and exile him from their community.  Sage now has permanent guests, something he's been asking of Nox for months now.

## Dev's Story

Who would have thought a chance meeting at work would lead to finding partners in life, but that's what happened and life took and interesting turn when they -yes, they- happened to be hunting the same demon that haunted Dev's girlfriend.

Dev had been flirting for tips he hadn't expected a customer to pull him across the bar for a kiss but that's how it started.  Running into Sage again had been coincidence and the date a complete success even with the surprise of bringing Dee along.  Dinner with the boyfriend went well except for his shields,Dev couldn't help but helping him out and that turned out to be the wrong move as a mara attacked.  Thankfully it was handled well, but it led them all down a rocky path to suicide watched and comes.  Helping Sage connect with Nox had been the right thing to do but it broke the pact with the demon that's was protecting Dee and she was in pain, Dev was glad he didn't have to deal with it alone.

## Dee's Story

After her father made a deal with a demon, Dee is forever grateful and willingly helps her savior until one day it threatens someone she cares for.

Dee's father made a deal with a demon, forever tying his daughter to it.  Dee lives a normal life, except for the occasional conversation with her demon, she and Dev meet another couple who is interesting.  But it turns out one of the other men is an enemy of her demon and she is asked to take the demon inside herself and escort it to her new 'lover'.  Feeling guilty after finding out that her friend is in a coma Dee agrees to help her friends with their plan and in their battle the demon is dispatched severing all ties it is bound to including her own.  All emotions rush back in and Dee is broken and in pain, but thankfully she has the help of those around her to get back on her feet even if it might kill her to do so.
