# The Orange Door

I paced outside the orange door in the lower Academy levels. My shirt ironically matched the color almost perfectly, but you could only see the v of it beneath the gray hoodie I had zipped almost all the way. My hair and nails matched my shirt today. I was trying not to be nervous, but my hands were sweating and my heart was racing. I wasn't sure I could do this, I had almost left several times, but I had to do this. No matter what it cost me. I had to do this.

The door opened and I froze facing the door and the man standing staring at me with his dirty brown eyes and that slimy smile. His smile only slide a fraction when he saw me. I tried to breath. I clenched my fist, digging my fingernails into the palm of my hand and I was sure I would see blood if I were to look at them now. "Nox, my boy." His voice was just as I remembered it. The only difference between when I was a boy and now was his hair had a touch of gray in it.

"I'm not your boy." I spit out. I was surprised at my own venom in my voice and I took a step back excepting him to lash out at me.

He only laughed at me. The sound grated on my ears and I shivered. "You will always be my boy. What can I do for you, my boy?" Garrett chuckled as he emphasized the last part of his sentence.

I wasn't sure how I managed to spit it out but I did. "I'm here to see Sam. Not you."

Garrett frowned. "Are you poaching my students?" He took a step towards me and I took a step back.

I shook my head. "I just want to talk to him."

Garrett snickered at my reaction. "Does his father know you are here?"

I shrugged. "I told him I would talk to him."

"I heard you and he had a falling out." Garret smiled a little too knowingly, like he knew what was going on, but then he didn't really. How could he? Or maybe he did know? The thing had said I was getting too close. Too close to what I'd thought then, was this that thing?

Garrett's smirk told me nothing. "He's a very good student, much like you were I think. He's collecting his things." Garrett pushed the orange door open and a small boy who looked like Dylan did when he was that age. Or would have if I'd known him then. Garrett waved a farewell to Sam, "Nox here will make sure you make your next class."

I muttered "Thank you," to Garrett as he left us alone in the room that I disliked.


# Meeting Sam

The boy looked startled when Garrett spoke to him. If his training was anything like mine, the boy was lost inside his head trying to come back to the reality of things. Seeing what was truly real.

He looked up at me with wide brown eyes and I saw a tear slide down his cheek. I knelt down in front of him and wiped it away with the pad of my thumb. "Hi, Sam." I said in a soft quiet voice.

He gave me a shy smile. "I'm Nox." I held out my hand to shake hands and he took it in his hand with care and gave my hand a small squeeze before he let go of my hand. "I thought you had passed fire-started training."

Sam chocked on his words, "Me. too."

"Did Garrett pull you out of class?" I asked.

He shook his head, "No. My teacher sent me here. Said I had to do go one more time. Emma too, she was after me." He pointed down the hall. "She's down the hall waiting for... him."

The fear in his voice was not lost on me as he spoke of Garrett. I smiled at him. "Did he hurt you?"

Sam shook his head. But I could see the lie within his eyes. I gave him a smile to reassure him and asked as I tapped his head, "Did he hurt you inside here?"

The boy's eyes went wide. He scrambled away from me knocking over the chair. "It's not real. My mom and dad said so."

I stayed where I was and asked, "What isn't real, Sam?"

"The dreams. They aren't real. I'm imagining them, it's just in my head. You are in my head. I didn't tell my mom and dad I saw Emma. Or you." He gasped and whispered, "Or the others..." His words trailed off and he fell to the floor and wrapped his arms around his legs and started rocking back and forth.

I crawled to the boy and sat in front of him. "I'm real. Emma is real. I think they all are real." I held out my hand and touched his knee and he jumped. "See I'm real." I turned my hand palm up and wiggled my fingers begging him to take them without asking. "I'll tell you a secret."

He looked up at me tears shining in his eyes. "I have the same dreams. I've had similar ones since I was your age." I turned around on the floor and pulled my shirt and hoodie up over my head and I heard the boy gasp. Cold fingers touched my back and I froze. The prior fear from before increased tenfold and I could hear my ragged breath and my heart in my chest almost hurt it was pounding so hard.

There was movement behind me and the cold fingers on my hand taking my shirt and hoodie from my fingers and letting them fall back down over my back. The small arms of the boy wrapped around my neck from behind and he pressed his face into my neck. I felt him crying more than I heard him and I reached around and pulled him into my lap, his arms still around my neck and I held him while he cried. I whispered through my dissipating fear, "I believe everything."


# Finding Emma

We sat wrapped around each other for a long time.  No one bothered us here.  We'd only be kicked out if there was a scheduled lesson.  Sam stopped crying and I hugged him tight before I held him away from me.  "Can you take me to Emma?  We need to stop this."

Sam nodded and stood up and took my hand.  "This way."

I stood up and pulled my shirt and hoodie down and followed Sam through the halls of the Academy to another orange door and I tried not to let my fear of what we'd find.  The rooms were sound proof but you didn't hear any sounds coming in.  We went up stairs to the observation room and saw Emma with her hands pressed to the wall and Sam gasped and I felt my heart jump into my throat.  Garrett was standing behind her whispering in her ear.  Sam's hand tightened around my hand.  He pulled himself closer.  Fury rose up inside and I touched the intercom button.  "Open the door Garret."  I was a lot braver when I was this far away from him.  I didn't know if it's would last, but I wasn't going to let him hurt that little girl anymore.

He looked up into the observation room looking for me, but he couldn't see, he knew better. I touched few more buttons on the panel with the intercom and then I went down stairs and I pounded on the door.  Garrett opened the door and had tentacle of air behind him like he did in my nightmares.

Sam hid behind my leg and held onto me whimpering.  I glared back at the man.  "You won't hurt them anymore."

Garrett laughed. "You think you have a backbone now?"

The air whip cracked in the air and I stood my ground.  "You will not hurt them again!"

A second and third whip joined the first and they all began cracking in the air like thunder.  Sam was crying behind me, clawing at my leg and it spurred me on.  I was waiting for him to hit me.  If he'd just hit me I'd be in my right to fight back.

Garrett laughed at me and he turned towards the little girl who was standing oblivious to what was happening around her, she was lost in the dream of her mentor.  The same dream Sam and I knew well.  He let one of the air whips crack against her skin.  She screamed silently still lost in the dream state but the pain was real. But the blood and the laceration on the girl's skin were real and that was more than enough for me.  I flung an net of air at Garrett and he flew to the wall behind me.  I spoke softly to Sam.  "Wake Emma, Sam.  Wake her and go upstairs and do not open the door for anyone but me.  Do you understand?"

Sam nodded his head and he went Emma and shook her and shook her until she came out of the daze crying.  Her body was already healing but I wrapped her in the elements as they left and hoped it wouldn't scar.  "Shut the door behind you."

Sam and Emma hurried out and the door closed behind them.


# I’m Better Than You
I stalked over to Garrett and for the first time in my entire life I didn't feel like I was five in his presence.  I felt like the man I had become because of him.  Because of the things he did to me.  I wasn't weak.  I wasn't a doormat.  I wasn't some fucking toy.  I stopped a foot from the man who I despised with every fiber of my being.

And for the first time in his entire life Garrett stared back at me with fear.  I took a deep breath and had to take a step back.  My anger was racing around me, I could see fire spinning waiting to be unleashed.  I felt the heat of the room rising.  I took another step back and focused on the connections around me.  I thought about Drake and how he would never have a person like this in his life.  I wouldn't let anyone hurt Faelen ever again.  I would help Matt discover his true talent.  But most of all I focused on all those I loved.  I had people in my life.

I sneered at Garrett.  "You won't take them from me."

I took a step back and released Garrett from the net of air and he fell to the floor in heap.  "I recorded your attack on me.  I recorded the fear Sam has for you.  But more importantly I recorded you hurting that little girl.  You will never touch another kid again.  If I find you near any child I will put a bullet in your brain faster than you can say my name.  And it is with in my right as Venatori to take the life of someone who harms his own by the Clandestine Providence.  You do not fucking hurt children!"

I turned around and walked quickly out the room and left the orange door wide open as I turned and went up into the observation room and knocked on the door.  "Sam let me in."

The door quickly unlatched and two sets of arms wrapped around me and I sank to the ground and pulled them both into my arms.  "He won't touch you again."  They cried and I cried with them.  "No one was going to hurt them again.  I would make sure of it."


# Protection
At the bottom of the stairs we heard Garrett open the door and when I looked down he was staring up at the three of us.  But he huffed and turned back down the hall and I assumed to security to see about getting the recording.  I stood up with the kids in my arms and let them find their feet.  "I have to get that recording."

The let me move but as soon as I was standing in front of the console they were attached to me again.  I worked as quickly as I could and saved the file of the camera to my phone which I then sent to Sage with a message.  "Keep this safe for me, love.  I'll explain in a bit."

He sent me a quick reply, "Got it."

I put my phone away and knelt down between the two kids and smiled at them.  I knew how to shield myself from a lot of things.  We could protect ourselves from mental intrusion by paths.  I don't know why I never thought of trying it with Garrett, maybe because I didn't realize he was still in my head. But these kids hadn't learned how to shield anything.  I knew pack magic could protect from some things, but I wasn't pack.  But Adrian insisted I was.  So I focused on that one truth, the hope that I could protect these kids from themselves.  I pulled on that invisible connection, the pack bond.  And I felt Sage, I heard him gasp in my head.  I felt Drake.  I blinked when I felt Matt there too... When the fuck did I did I do that?  Faelen was there too.  I couldn't see them, but I felt them.  I could sense them.  And at a distance I felt others but I didn't know what that meant.

I extended that connection to the kids I wrapped them in that sense of safety that was the pack.  The home, the forest, safe.  Family.  Pack!  They both relaxed in my arms and I felt them next to me both physically and mentally.  I don't know what it all meant, but if it kept them safe then I would take it.

I needed to talk to Adrian.  Or maybe Darwynn when he got back.  I kissed each of them on the head.  "I think you'll be safe now.  But you tell me if you aren't okay?"

They both nodded and I carried them down stairs and to their families.  I wanted to have a chat with them.


# Sam’s Mom

Sam's head was on my shoulder, Emma was just staring in behind us.  She was trembling with fear, I could feel her fear.  I muttered again, "He won't hurt you again.  And if he does I will take care of it."

Emma put her head on my shoulder and relaxed a little bit but we had made it to Sam's mother's place.  I didn't know if either would be home, but Sam seemed to think they would be.  I let him down when he squirmed and he produced a key and unlocked the door knocking before he did then turned the know and opened it.

A slight woman looked up from the couch she smiled at Sam and then frowned at me.  She got up and rushed over to us.  "Oh my god what happened?"  She was taking Emma from me but Emma clung tighter.

I held Emma to me.  "I don't think she will go with anyone but her parents right now.  They've been through a lot this past year.  And I think it's all over.  Can you call her parents?  And Dylan?  I need to talk to all of you."

She looked up and me and glared.  "And who are you?"

"It doesn't matter who I am, can you please call them?  It's important."  I asked again with a little more impatience.

She stepped away and made the call.  I heard her side of the conversation.  "Dylan, someone is here with Sam and Emma.  He wants to talk to their parents.  No, I don't know him.  Yes, tall, orange hair and nails and thick eyeliner, why? Should I be worried?"  The worry had started to increase in her voice I could only imagine what Dylan was saying on the other side of it, I could have tried to listen but it wasn't important.

She called Emma's parents and they said they'd be right over.  Emma clung to my neck but his mother finally took a look at Sam and she gasp and knelt down in front of him and took his face in her hands.  "Oh baby, did he hurt you?"

Sam nodded his head and that was all he could do before she was standing up and she was shoving me across the room.  "You don't have any right to hurt my kids."

I smirked a little and she slapped my face.  Sam took my hand and wrapped himself around my leg and yelled, "Not him!"

I smiled to disarm her and she glared at me.  "I will explain it all when everyone is here."

The door rushed opened and the door knob slammed into my back making me wince in pain and Dylan stopped short but he was inside the apartment soon followed by who I assumed were Emma's parents.  I didn't know them.


# Venatori Parents Suck

Dylan didn't bother apologizing he was walking around me and looking at Sam who was clinging to my hand.  I smiled at Emma's parents.  "My name is Nox Sétanta.  I've been dreaming about your children."

The women gasped apparently they knew of the dreams.  "We might want to sit down and talk."  I said

Emma's father took my hand. "Tim.  And this is my wife Darla.  What's this about?"

"You might want to sit down."  I said and waved my hand to the couch sitting across the room.  There were enough seats for the four of them to sit down comfortably so I sat on the floor so I wasn't imposing.  I was about to tell them that someone had been abusing the children, but I had no proof of it.

Both Emma and Sam sat with me much to their parents disapproval.  I took a deep breath to calm my fear and my anger.  Both were still making me jittery and I was glad to be sitting down.  "18 years ago I came to the Venatori because I sparked.  My teacher was Garrett Spencer.  And he has the ability to make me see things that aren't there - to feel things that aren't real.  When I graduated into regular classes he tried to hurt me again, and I sparked.  He said it was an accident, I suppose hoping it was another year I could spend with him.  But it wasn't an accident.  I knew what I was doing.  I lit him on fire on purpose because I wasn't going to let him hurt me again."

Sam clung to my arm and Emma was still wrapped around me and her hands squeezed tighter.  The both knew I said the truth, they had gone through it.  "But that next year I started having dreams, almost immediately after I stopped seeing Garrett.  I saw the same things he did to me in my head, except now I was hurting myself with my own ability.  I can open my psychiatric records to you if you don't believe me."

Darla cried out, "Why should we believe some crazy?"

I ignored her and continued with a sigh.  "While I was out with Dylan last month, shortly after Dylan told me Sam was having nightmares and had scars on his back like I have on mine I had a dream.  I dreamt of 5 other kids other than myself who Garrett was sending the same nightmare too.  A pair of glowing eyes, mine are red, but change colors if I'm scared about something else.  The eyes get closer and that's when the hooded figure starts sprouting tentacles of the elements and they lash across my back.  I can't scream.  I can't move.  Doing either only makes it worse.  When the hooded figure is in front of me with those glowing red eyes he removes the hood exposing who is really there.  But I never get to see the face clearly."

"You could just be reciting what the kids have been telling you.  It's almost word for word." Sam's mom said, I think her name was Lisa.

"I wish that were the case, but this is the first time I've met either Sam or Emma.  That was the dream I've had every night for the past 18 years.  I have it every night unless I feel completely safe.  Every morning for the past 18 years I have drawn the images I saw.  I have 18 years worth of sketches set aside that I can have brought up to my apartment if you really want to see them."

I hugged the two kids to me.  And spoke to Sam, "Why don't you show Emma your room?"  The both held tighter.  I reached in my back pocket and pulled out my wallet, and two cards and handed one to each kid.  "I want to show them what I recorded.  But I don't want you to see it again, to live it again.  Okay?  This is my card.  My personal number is on it.  You can call me anytime.  Night or day if you are scared alright?"

Sam and Emma both took the cards and looked at it.  "Can you go play?"  Sam offered Emma his hand and she took it, and the two six year olds went off down the hall.

I took out my phone.  "There has never been proof that Garrett was the one doing.  The footage in the fire-starter rooms just shows what you'd expect to see. The big difference between what he did with me, and the other kids was my tapes only show me with my hands on the wall and nothing else.  Because he was in my head doing the rest."  I played the video of Emma.  Her hands were against the wall and nothing else until I pounded on the door.

When the lash of air landed on the back of Emma the parents eyes went wide.  His small confession was lost on them as they watched him.  Dylan looked at me over my phone.  "Why didn't you kill him?"

I chuckled.  "Do you know me at all?"

"He hurt you.  He hurt Sam.  He hurt Emma and all you do is threaten him."

I shook my head.  "That's not all I'm going to do."

All four parents stood up and towered over me.  Lisa pointed a the door.  "Get the fuck out.  You don't care about our kids.  Just your reputation."

I sighed. Venatori sucked!  I nodded, "Fine.  But don't let Garrett near them again."

Tim frowned, "Like we needed you to tell us that."

I was at the door and I turned around with a smirk on my face and opened the door for a speedy escape.  "Well maybe if you had listened to your kids instead of thinking they made shit up they wouldn't have needed me to save them."  I stepped out of the room and slammed the door behind me.


# Calling Dad

After dealing with a bunch of dip shit parents I needed to go for a run.  I changed clothes in my apartment and then I went for a run.  I ran for a good hour before I found myself at Sage’s house.  I called my Dad while I sat down on the front stoop of his house.  I was still catching my breathe when he picked up.  “Hello?” he said.

“Hey Dad.  Can you pick up Drake and watch him.  I’ll come get him later?”

He chuckled, “What about Faelen?”

“He can stay in the studio when he gets out of school.  You can stop by if you are hungry I’m sure he cooks better than you do.” I teased.

Kai laughed, “Of course he does.  I don’t cook.  And your boys are too spoiled to eat in the cafeteria.”

“Will you pick up Drake?”  I asked again.

“Yes, son, I will, I love my grandsons.”

“They love you too Dad.  I’ll call if I can’t make it home, but Fae can watch Drake for the night.”

“They can both stay with me Nox.”

“Thanks Dad.”


# I Need a Break

I hung up the phone and walked around the side of Sage’s house and knocked on the side door where my love was still working.  He called out, “It’s unlocked.”

I opened the door and shut it behind me before I put my hands on his shoulders and he looked up at me with a smile. “Hey, Nox.  What do I owe this pleasure?”

“I needed a break.  Venatori parents are a pain in the ass.  I think that no matter what their kids say they don’t care.  And when they are given proof that their kids were wrong they blame everyone but themselves.”

Sage frowned as he turned back and started typing again.  He said, “That’s how most people are, I don’t think it’s solely a Venatori thing.”

I sighed, “You are right, but at least there are other people the kid can go to that might believe them and find the answers in your world.”

Sage turned in his chair and pulled me down into his lap.  “You okay?”

I pressed my face to his neck and nodded,”I am now.”

He turned back in his chair and started typing again with one hand while the other played idly with my back.  I still froze when he did it but I relaxed almost immediately into his arms.


# Lost in Thought

I think I fell asleep in his lap because the next thing I knew he was tapping my back and whispering, “Nox.  I need to get up.”

I stretched as I extracted myself from his lap and he shook his head, “Like a baby.”

I grinned at him, “Hungry?”

“Always.”  Sage intoned.  And I went into the house via the stairs inside and into the kitchen to make something to eat.  The kitchen was still as gorgeous as the first time I’d seen it, but now it looked used.  Sage still burnt water - how the fuck do you burn water?  But I’d seen it happen, twice!

Sage’s fridge was always stocked.  Even when I wasn’t there for a few days Sage had home cooked meals.  And I didn’t bore him with my schedule of eating habits, I was learning what he liked and I made it for him even if I wouldn’t eat it.  It wasn’t the boyfriend thing I was doing, it was my thing.  The shit Sage ate he ate for convenience so I made it more convenient for him to stay home.  Sometimes Sage would ask for a full course meal so he could take it to his parents or have his friends over.  Usually I cooked those before they got there and they were hot when he wanted to show off.  I didn’t stick around I wasn’t ready to be that far indoctrinated into Sage’s life.  And he wasn’t either.    Though everyone already knew I practically lived with him.

It was still an argument.  It would be until things settled in, but I was working on it no matter how inactive it seemed to be.  I was always working on it.  But it wasn't easy being Venatori and it wasn't easy to leave the campus after living there so long.  Not that five years was a long time.  But it was what it was.




# Company

I was nearly done with lunch, it was just sandwiches made from left over steak we'd had the night before.  Sage would just eat it plain, I liked to use it to make something else with.  But Sage ate anything I offered him.

Sage walked into the kitchen with a smile.  "I always like seeing you cooking in my kitchen."

I smiled back at him and when he came close enough I pulled him close by his hip and kissed him.  I told him, "I think it's my kitchen now."

He laughed.  I loved that laugh, the one that said he was happy.  His blue eyes were bright with joy and I could see them darkening with lust.  But he took a step back and separated us with the island.  The island was often used that way, when we got too intense.  Which happened often.

"Nox?" Sage asked and when I looked at him he continued on.  "This Friday, I invited over some people.  I'd like you to cook something impressive and meet them."

"Alright."  I said as I pushed a sandwich in his direction and took a bite of my own.  It wasn't anything special.  Just steak sliced then with mayo and mustard and fresh tomatoes and a good provolone.  I'd have preferred mozzerella and basil on it as well, but we didn't have any left since Sage liked the combination as well and ate it every night as a midnight snack.

"No questions?"  Sage looked at me over his sandwich.

"I assume you want me to meet the couple you've been seeing."  I said.  There was no judgement in my voice.  But Sage blushed none-the-less.  We had an open relationship.  I didn't choose to partake of the situation, but it was something Sage needed to do right now, and I didn't judge him on it.

Sage's eyes had dropped to his plate.  "You don't mind?"

I reached across the island and lifted his eyes to mine, "If you are ready then so am I.  If they are ready then that's even better.  I assume they know of me?"

He laughed.  "Yes."  He breathed out quickly.  I was missing something but he was done with the conversation and his fingers played along mine and he took them in his hand and we finished lunch.

# Reflection

Lunch with Sage turned into dinner with Sage and the next two days pretty much followed the same pattern.  Except my dreams.  While there was no heart bursting, shooting awake moments, there was fear when I woke up.  It wasn't my fear that I felt.  I woke up safe against Sage's side, his arm wrapped around my back, and my head pressed against his chest and shoulder.  The best part of Sage growing up with a pack was they liked to touch, and Sage didn't mind that I needed it.  We had started out apart, but always I ended up next to him so we stopped trying to stay to our own sides.

I knew who two of the three other kids were from my dreams while I was away.  I hadn't dared sleep away from Sage since what I'd tried with Sam and Emma, but neither of them had called me or gotten in touch with me so I assumed things were good for them.  I hoped they were.  I didn't want them afraid.  I would do something else if I had to.

Sage and Dorian were both still looking for that third boy for me, while I was working with the Academy to try and get me in touch with both of the other boys.  Right now it was coming down to the parents didn't want me talking to their kids.  Apparently Dylan and his wife and Emma's parents had given a warning to someone about me.  Dorian was trying his best, but he could only do so much without invoking their wrath as well and he was to proper for that.  But I knew he was trying.

I had a meeting with Darwynn later.  The next batch of kids to go on survival was about to head out in a few days and I wanted to make sure he understood what I was asking of him.  I also wanted to touch base see how he was settling into his new life.  He wasn't some all powerful leader now.  He was a lackey.  I expected he'd rise, but right now he was nothing where James Wright was concerned.  I just hoped that he kept my name out of his conversations.  Last thing Darwynn needed was my name dragging him through the mud.

We were meeting at a neutral location.  And for Venatori and CCB that meant the Night Life building.  We'd grab a cup of coffee and talk.  Sounded perfectly normal, except it wasn't.



# Coffee Shop Talk

I was always marveled by the Night Life building.  The money that was sunk into the reseach alone was mind boggling.  Every window pane in the glass blocked the harmful rays of the sun that killed a vampire.  It's no ordinary glass.  It's not UV blocking.  It's something else.  Someone more scientific minded my be able to tell you more, but it was a marvel to watch old vampires step into the sun light for the first time since they were embraced.

And you'd think with that many vampires walking around the building it would be a blood bath.  Humans, vampires, therians, they all walked together, talked.  It was harmory at it's finest.  Still the humans didn't know vampires walked among them.  They were oblvious to the magics of the Clandestine Providence.  But the vampires didn't become exhibitionists here for one simple fact.  At the second top most floor lived the scarest fucking vampire they knew.  It was her money that paid for them to walk in the sunlight.  If that wasn't enough for them to have her respect, but she had it long before that.

We are the things that go bump in the night.  Cari Giovanni, Il Cane, The Hound, whatever name you want to call her by she is what bumps back.  Venatori fear her.  Therians fear her.  Vampires run and hide if the think she's around.  It is her mere potential presnence that keeps the Night Life blood free.  Or rather keeps the blood flowing in the human veins were it belongs.  It is harmony as it should be - how the rest of the world should be.  But outside these walls, it's everyone for themselves.

I found Darwynn sitting at a table already with two coffees he pushed on towards me.  "Black.  Just the way you like it."  He shuddered.  "I have no idea how you can drink it like that."

"For a big bad tough werelion you sure are a pansey."  I grinned at him.

"Look who's talking.  When's the last time you were woken by your nightmares."  He said it with a smile.  It was a joke.  He'd seen my nightmares - blood free nightmares.  If hed know the reality of it he might not be joking about it right now.

He smelled the fear and he took a long draw of his coffee before he said.  "So what's the job?"

"Same as I told you when you came here.  I need you to go where the kids are going.  Contact the therians in the neighborhood and broker peace for me."

"You want me, a therian to broker peace with people I don't know for kids I don't know?"  Darwynn shook his head, "I don't know what you think I'm capable of."

"Same thing I'm capable of.  Talk to them, charm them.  Tell them I owe them."  I pulled a small box of cards from my pocket and shoved them across the table.  "Tell them, I'd owe them.  If they leave my people unharmed I'll help them out.  There is no reason your kind and my kind can't coexist.  The kids aren't learning to kill yours out there.  They are learning to survive."

"So they can hunt my kind in the future."  Darwynn said.

I sighed.  "Not all of them."

"Nox.  I don't think this is going to do any good.  We can't co-exist.  You hunt us without prejudice."

"We do not.  We hunt those who go rogue.  If there are Venatori who are hunting you for sport then that needs to stop."  I said a little too loud and we got stares from some of the nearby tables.

"Who's gonna stop it, you?"  Darwynn sounded skeptical.

"Sure, why not.  I'll protect the kids and stop illegal hunting, why not.  What have I got to lose."

Darwynn frowned, "Your life, your family, everything you've ever known for starters."

I shrugged with a grin.  "I'd give my life if it meant those kids don't get killed.  Sage isn't going anywhere, Drake, Fae and Matt are the only other people in my life that matter, so as long as they are with me I'm fine."

"What you don't love me?"  He laughed.

I smirked as I looked Darwynn over, checking him out.  I'd done it before, hell I'd seen the man naked not too long back.  Shifters and clothes were like a nudist colonly - clothing optional.  "You aren't my type."  I snickered.  Which was a total lie because before Sage, he was precisely the type of guy I would look for.  But that didn't matter now.  I had Sage.  And Sage was about to introduce me to his friends.

I stood up and dropped a few bucks on the table, "Give them my card.  Tell them to call me when there is a problem.  If there is a poacher in the neighborhood, or if there is Venatori, or they have a kid who got caught up in something bad, or he's changed and they can't do anything about it.  Anything, no problem to small.  I'll deal with it.  You might end up back there, but I'll take it.  I'll find a solution.  And all they have to do is not kill the survival classes."

Darwynn sighed, "I'll try, but I can't guarantee you anything.  But you are paying me well for this trip so I'll do my damnedest to get you what you want."

"That's all I ask, Darwynn."  We shook hands and I was off to Sage's house.

# Nerves

I wasn't a date kinda guy. And this felt very much like this was a date.  I was cooking.  Sage was comfortable with them.  They'd been on a few dates but that was about all I knew except that he smelled like them everytime he'd seen them.

Sage was wearing blue jeans and a black t-shirt with Tony Starks arc-reactor in the center of his chest.  It was one of my favorite shirts so I knew what it was.  He was grinning at me while I was cooking our dinner.  Sage had requested I make garlic and white wine chicken with whatever sides I wanted.  He even said that he eat a regular old tossed salad if I made that.

So I made what Sage asked.  It was staying warm in the oven while I took a shower and tried to find something to wear.  Sage was doing the casual thing, but he was already comfortable with his friends, I'm not sure I was.  I remembered being nervous the first time I took Sage out.  And now was really no different.  Sage came up behind me and wrapped his arms around me while I was putting on my eyeliner.  He pressed his cheek to my scars.  "There is nothing to be nervous about."

"I'm not nervous." I lied.  Sage laughed and pressed his lips to my back.

The door bell rang and Sage jumped.  "I didn't know that worked."

"I had Dorian send someone over to fix it.  Same with the squeaking back door and the basement door."  I said.

Sage turned me around, "How much did that cost you?"

"Don't worry about it."  I said and pulled him down to kiss.  I loved that I was shorter than him.  It was a novelty.

The bell rang again.  "Shit.  This isn't over."  He kissed my cheek and walked out of the bedroom.  "Wear the blue long sleeves.  It's my favorite."

I grinned, "Okay."

# Dinner Date

I came downstairs wearing a pair of black jeans, a black t-shirt and the blue shirt Sage liked.  The one that matched his eyes.  My hair was easy enough to change to the sapphire blue, but I still had black painted nails.  It was about five minutes after Sage had left to answer the door and I found a man I vaguely recognized waiting for me at the bottom of the stairs while a short brunette was pressing herself up against Sage and kissing him savagely.

The guy stood at the base of the steps and I stopped just short of the bottom so I was towering above me still.  He took a step back into the foyer and smiled.  "Devin.  That's Dee.  Sage is a bit busy at the moment."

I grinned.  "I see that.  Glad to finally put the scents to the people."  I gave him a bright smile and waved him into the kitchen down the hall.  "No point in standing there while they do their thing."

"It doesn't bother you?"  Devin asked ask he followed me.

I glanced over my shoulder and turned around to walk backwards.  "It bothers me a little."

"You don't remember me do you?  All those times in the club just blur together for you."  Devin smirked as he sat down at the bar.

I shrugged.  "I see a lot of people. I know I've seen you somewhere but I could have seen you at Aspect, or Flit or some other club.  Or I could have met you on the subway."

Devin laughed and he walked around the bar and pulled me close and kissed me hard.   His tongue slid between my lips and I moaned.  He chuckled, "You remember that?"

"I..."

Sage walked in while Devin was still in my personal space, but it was the woman behind him that spoke "I see he doesn't waste any time."

She walked up to Devin and wrapped her arm around his waist and pulled him down and kissed him.  I stepped away and she grabbed my hand and I paused.  She looked up at me with a soft smile, "You two tasted good together."

I tried to move away again and Devin took her hand from my arm, "Let him go, he's trying to feed us."

I gave him a smile in thanks and pulled the food out of the oven and started plating the dishes out.  I glanced at the three of them talking together on the other side of the island.  Dee was pretty.  She was much short then Devin and Sage by several inches but she felt taller than either of them at times.  Her presence was demanding.  It made me smile.  Her hazel eyes sparkled as she spoke to the boys with animation.

Just then the front door burst open and the three boys came in.  I looked at Sage, "You didn't tell them to go to the studio or Kai's?"

Sage frowned.  "I forgot I'm sorry."

"Finish plating I got it."  I smiled at him.


# Interrruptions

Matt was in the hall holding Drake and he and Fae were laughing.  I walked out and smiled.  "Hey guys."

"Daddy!" Drake called out.

I heard footsteps behind me.  I glanced behind me and saw Devin following me.  Matt frowned, "We were supposed to go to Mr. Viddens weren't we?"

"Sage's memory is shit, he forgot to tell you."  I shrugged, "But ya'll can stay for dinner, just go downstairs, and stay down there."

I pointed at Devin, "This is Devin.  Dee's in the kitchen.  Devin."

He interrupted me, "Dev."

I grinned at him.  "Dev, this is Matt, holding Drake and the shy one back there is Fae. These are my boys."

Sage called out from the kitchen, "They're mine to Nox."

Matt laughed, "We are all family.  Though my dad is getting annoyed at all the time I spend here.  Says it ain't right."

"If you need to spend less time we understand."  I said as I pulled my wallet out of my pocket.  "Buy pizza, be quiet and keep the other two downstairs."

Matt took the money I offered him and kissed my cheek before he went downstairs with Drake after ushering Fae downstairs.

I turned to see the bartender from Aspect staring at me with a smirk.  He laughed, "So now you remember me.  He likes you know know?"

I nodded. "I know.  I don't encourage him.  It's a crush."

Dev laughed, "It's not a crush.  He'd do anything for you.  It's not in love with you, at least not like that.  He's jealous of Drake and Fae because they are yours."

I smiled at Dev.  "He's mine, just not on paper."

"Sage neglected to tell us of the boys."  Dev said.  He walked over to me and pressed me up against the wall.  "They are in there discussing the merits of your cooking.  We should join them."

I pressed a kiss to his lips.  "Yeah, we should."  I stared into his baby blue eyes and smiled.  "You're a telepath?"

He nodded.  "Didn't take you long to figure it out."

"You keep poking around in my head, course I'm going to notice."  I grinned.  "You see anything fun in there."

Dev smiled.  "I don't dig. Let's go eat."  He took my hand and pulled me into the kitchen.

# Let's Eat

Dee and Sage were chatting happily while eating.  I plated myself and Dev and set a place next to Sage and Dee but he pulled it back to the same side and stood with me.  "I can stand."

Dee asked, "So Nox, what do you do for a living?"

"I'm a bounty hunter."

Dee giggled, "Oh, that's exciting.  Do you have any cool stories?"

"Not really.  I have had a few runners, but most of them pretty quietly."  I said between mouthfuls. "What do to you two do for a living?"

Sage was grinning at me.  "What?" I asked him.

"Nothing."  He said then stuffed his mouth mouth with chicken and let out a simple moan that sent a shiver up my spine.

There was a small awkward silence before Dev laughed, "He likes watching you with me.  But I'll answer your question to change the subject.  I tend bar at Aspect, but I would like to consider myself a pretty good musician."

"He's pretty good."  Sage added.  "Not that you would like any of it, not exactly dance worthy."

"I like music."  I countered.

Dee put her hand in her curly brown hair and twirled.  "I'm a nurse at Mount Sinai.  I have some doozies I could tell.  Dev has some stories he could tell.  I remember one story about a guy on the dance floor who's boyfriend was a tease."

Dev smirked.  "I think they were both teases.  Though I only got a kiss from one."

Sage was blushing.  I kinda felt the same but I just grinned at them.  "I vaguely remember you wanting to watch something else, or at least that's what Sage said."  There was a nice rose color running up Sage's neck and cheeks and it was growing darker at the reminder.

Dee ran her finger along his jaw line and he suqirmed.  He moved away and put his plate in the sink.  "I don't remember that."  He chocked out.  Dev gathered the rest of the plates and followed Sage.

Dee reache across the island and ran her fingers over my hand.  "You are cuter than Sage said.  And I thought I'd be disappointed with dinner."

"What a guy can't cook?" I asked with sarcasm.

"No, I'm just used to doing the cooking.  Our roommates don't know how to cook worth a crap and I get used to that."  Dee said.  "It's good to have someone who will cook for me."

"I'll cook for you anytime, Duckling."

"Aww, already with the pet names."  Dee giggled.

Sage laughed, "He calls every girl Duckling."


# What Now

Dee grabbed me by the hand and pulled me around the island.  "Let them clean up.  You cooked."

I looked back at Sage with Dev pressed up against him like they were lovers and I was jealous. But Dee was dragging me into the living room and said, "Sit."

I did.  Promptly, like it was an order.  Not exactly sure why my body responded but it didn't.  I sure wasn't going to submit to her.  I didn't know her.  But she smiled harmlessly at me and I grinned back.  "Sage has told us what he's looking for.  What we want to know is what you are looking for?"

I shrugged.  "I'm not looking for anything.  I want Sage to be happy.  He doesn't do one night stands so my typical go-to add a third doesn't work here.  So he's looking for partners."

"We know.  What do you want out of it?"  she asked with her hand on my knee.

"I am not looking for anything out of it."

She pulled her hand away from my knee and frowned, "So you'll just have sex with us.  Nothing more?"

I shrugged.  "Look Dee, I don't know what will happen if we have sex regularly.  I didn't exactly plan on falling in love with a voyeuer much less Sage.  I don't do relationships on a general basis.  We'll negotiate and then we'll see where it goes."

She smiled and put her hand back on my knee and ran it up my thigh sending shivers down my spine.  "My plans for the night are kind of shot since you have three young boys downstairs."

I grinned.  "That's Sage's fault not mine."

"So I understand."  Dev and Sage walked in to the living room.  Dev sat down on the other side of me and Sage sat in the arm chair facing us.  He had this smirk on his face that said he was happy.  Dee spoke, "Nox says we can negotiiate terms and see where it goes."



# Negotiations

"Dee and I are flexible."  Dev said, his words reverberated down my body and he hadn't even touched other than press of his leg against mine.  I closed my eyes and savored the feel of his leg against mine.  Dee's hand crept higher until it was barely touching my groin through the blue jeans.

Sage cleared his throat and my eyes opened and looked across at him, his blue eyes were dark with lust and he was enjoying the show.  This was precisely what he wanted.  Sage spoke quietly, "We are couples, that doesn't change, I want to watch you two having sex with Nox."

"Always at the same time?"  Dee asked.

"Whatever you want."  Sage breathed out as Dee ran her hand over jeans covered cock and I shuddered.

Dev chuckled, "Dee stop teasing him."

"It's alright." I smiled at him as I thought _I'd like you to be doing more_.

Dev smirked at me.  I don't know what he was thinking but I was pretty sure he had heard the thought.  It was interesting having a telepath around.  The secrets could remain secret.

Sage's voice sounded broken across the distance, "We could go up stairs the boys won't bother us."

Dev stood up and took Dee's hand from my crotch and pulled her to her feet.  "No, I think we all need a little time part before we get into this.  Take care of you boy Sage.  I think you've been neglecting him."

Both of them stood over me and I wanted to move but I couldn't. I  could barly stammer out "He's not.  I promise."  I was staring at his midsection and wanted to mouth his cock through his jeans.  But I looked up and Dev watching me.  His fingers ran across my temple and I heard a new thought _maybe later pretty boy_.  A shiver ran up my spine at his touch and his words and I could only nod.

Dee and Dev walked towards the door and I finally made my body move by the time Sage was kissing them both goodnight.  Dee grinned at me, "And where is ours?"

I sighed and moved to kiss her first.  Where Sage had kissed them with neat press of his lips to theirs, Dee pulled me down and and slid her tongue into my mouth.  I pulled away breathless and surprised.  She laughed, "You taste like Dev."

Devin snickered and grabbed my t-shirt then pulled me close.  He was my height and I stared perfectly into those baby blues.  My heart beat faster, my pulse raced.  Why was he manipulating me so easily?

He pressed his lips to mine.  It was a simple kiss but my knees felt weak and I could have easily fallen under his spell.  _Do you want me to stop?_  he thought at me though the touch.  Dev let my shirt go and we parted with my heart in my throat.

I whispered, "No."  And Dev smirked.

"We'll see you later.  Sage we'll make a date we can all get together for some fun."  Dee said as they walked down the front steps out into the street.  They were arm in arm walking together like any typical couple.  But I knew they weren't typical - anymore than Sage and I were typical.

# Do You Like Them?

Sage watched them walk down the street and around the corner before he closed the door.  I was already in the kitchen making sure things were in order so I didn't have a freak out later.  Sage came in chuckling, "Don't trust us?"

"Trust you just fine, just thought you might have gotten a little distracted with Dev here."  I quipped back.

"Do you like them, Nox?"  Sage pulled out a stool from under the island and sat down while he watched me putter around the kitchen not really doing much of anything.  It was a calming task for me.

"I hardly know them.  They were hot.  Cute together.  You obviously like them.  They like you."

"They like you too."  Sage grinned.  "Dee likes you that's for sure.  Dev's hard to read."

I shook my head, "He's a telepath, he probably is used to keeping his motives to himself."

"What?"  Sage sounded shocked.  He hadn't known?  "How do you know?"

I smiled, "He was reading my mind.  Commenting on things I never actually said out loud."  I leaned across the island and took Sage's hand in mine, "He's a high level one from what I can tell.  But I don't think he can broadcast his thoughts to others over a distance. You are safe."

"I..."  Sage stammered.

"You watch too many of those stupid sci-fi shows." I interrupted his denial.  "I know you Sage, you were thinking he could make you do things you didn't want."  I pulled a hand to my lips and kissed it gently.  "Trust me, you are safe.  I'm pretty sure he needs physical contact to pass along his thoughts.  So unless you've been doing things you don't normally do with Dev touching you don't worry about it."

Sage sighed.  "Your world is always interesting."

I laughed.  "They aren't my world.  You brought them here."

Sage frowned, "Yeah.  I didn't know he was supernatural."

"She is too.  Though it's all weird around her.  I can't figure it out."

"More of those things I can't see.  Patterns?"  Sage asked.

I nodded.  "Yeah.  It's hard to explain.  I don't even think I could try to someone who'd undstand what I said."

"Maybe Dorian can help?"  Sage suggested.

"It's not a big deal.  We'll figure it all out."

Sage let go of my hands and walked around the other side of the island and trapped me against it between his long arms.  "Am I neglecting you?"  he whispered against my neck before nuzzling close and kissing softly.

I shook my head and mummured, "No."  He had been seeing them often, but he had been taking care of me too.  I wasn't jealous of them.  Nor of the attraction they had for my boyfriend.  Sage wanted more than I could give him alone.  I was happy with all of that.

# Finally

Sage and I had some fun in the wake of my meeting Dev and Dee.  It was a unqiue experience.  Sage asking a lot of questions about what I wanted.  What I needed.  He seemed very keen on the idea of sharing me with others.  I wasn't sure about it still, but I was happy to make Sage happy.  He was like a new person.

I was up and ready by 6am.  I had breakfast and the kids moving by 7 and we were all at the AU building by 8 on time and ready to go for our days.  It was Saturday, but I still lived in the building, and technically so did Matt.  Though we spent most of our time at Sage's.  Matt had a special pass to stay with us.  He couldn't stay the night on the weekdays but every weekend he was with us.

We were still finding a place for Faelen.  He wasn't eager to go to school with Venatori.  And I wouldn't be after what he'd been through.  But he didn't want to be around other therians.  The idea scared him more than it did being with the Venatori.  And I wasn't sure I wanted him in a human school.  We had a few more days to figure it all out before people cam knocking on our door.

But what surprised me most about the start of my day was that a note was sitting on my desk at work on top of all the files Dae'lin wanted me to look into.  I still wasn't doing field duty.  I was lucky I wasn't on mandatory leave after having been taken control of my a powerful dragon.  And then I thrawted a Venatori ploy and now I was working against them, even though they didn't know that yet.

The note read:

> Dear Mr. Sétanta,
> We have granted you an hour of time with Jeffery Taylor and Marvin Thomas  starting at 8:30 today to extend till 10:30 in the fish bowl.
>
> We realize there is a conflict in your schedule but this is the only time the boys are available.
>
> Sincerely,
> Richard Weston, Headmaster

It was about damned time.

# Interference

I was early as I sat in the fishbowl waiting.  It wasn't the most ideal place, but I was lucky that they'd granted me permission at all.  So I would take all I could get.  While the great thing about the fishbowl was I could watch everyone who passed by.  But they could watch me too.

Not that I cared, but me in my eyeliner and blue dyed tips always got a second glance back through the glass walls.  It was either recognition, or curiousity that brought their eyes back to me.  Curious about what I was doing there.  Curious about who I was never really crossed their minds.  The Venatori seemed like a large group with most of us living all with in one building, but we went very large a race.  We were a couple hundred thousand strong and that was it.  We were born, we hunted, we died.  It was the cycle of our life, but we still didn't know every Venatori, but here in New York City everyone kinda knew every one else.  We mostly all lived here, and worked here.  This was the main headquarters after all, we had the resources to house may more Venatori too.

Most of our eggheads, the Scrin were in this building.  There was another facility like the Archives in London.  But that was smaller housed fewer Venatori but it was the EuroAsia headquarters.  The rest of our facilities were just halfway houses for small stays and checks.  They had miminal resources and most of that was just weapons.

Two boys were escorted to Dae'lin's office across the hall.  I saw them and recognized them immediately from my dream.  I sat up straighter when I saw them, they blinked back at me in recognition. We all knew what had happened was real.  I could see the pain they hid in their eyes.

The were sat down in the office and the man who'd escorted him I knew well.  He was headmaster of the Academy, I'd been sent to his office on many occassions.  Right before he'd send me back to Dorian for my disciplining.

Richard Weston was a good man.  He walked in to the fishbowl and sat down across from me.  He looked a little older than the last time I'd seen him.  He had some grey in his hair and the glasses on his nose didn't quite fit as well as they once used to, he'd lost some weight.  I grinned at him. "For once I'm not in your office," I declared.

He let lose a hearty laugh, like he'd been holding something back too long.  It wasn't funny, it wasn' humor but he laughed.  I watched as he doubled over and then started coughing.  He sighed as he sat up to catch his breath.  "I'm sorry.  This whole mess is just that a mess."

I nodded.  "Did you get the recording?"

Richard nodded.  "A full investigation has been launched and Sam and Emma are not with Mr. Spence any longer and shouldn't have any issues keeping him away from them."  He leaned back in his chair.  "These other boys haven't been in Garrett's care for a long time.  I'm noticing a pattern."

I closed my eyes and tried to keep my mind clear as I stood up and turned around.  My fingers were shaking, my hands were freezing against my skin as I pulled my t-shirt and hoodie up to reveal my back.  "Jesus Fucking Christ what the hell happened to you."

"You saw the recording.  While there is no proof Garrett hit me, he did it in my head.  And my nightmares today still produce those results.  He never hurt me, but somehow he's hurting us in our sleep."

Richard Weston sat forward in his chair and put his elbows on the table and stepled his fingers like I remembered him doing so many times over so many trips to his office.  "It's not possible.  Garrett isn't a dreamwalker.  After Emma and Sam claimed to say the same thing you have we had him tested.  It's not possible, Nox.  He's Magnus, he's an empath.  Nothing more."

"Then how the fuck does he get in our heads and torture us?"  I yelled at the headmaster.  I could feel the fury building around me and I knew if I didn't calm down I was going to be looking for an orange door to let loose all the built up energy.

I sat down and hung my head and too deep breaths.  The chair rolled across the floor and foot steps echoed in the silence of the room as Richard came around and put his hand on my shoulders and I jerked at the touch.  I didn't want comfort from a near stranger.  He squeezed ten let go and sat down beside me, turning my chair towards his.  "Son, we will look into it.  Don't you worry."

I sighed still looking down at the floor.  "He's still hurting us, so do what you can but..."  I looked up and stared into those grey eyes.  "I'm not going to stop until this stops."

Richard nodded.  "You were always like a dog with a bone."

"Sir, I'd like to talk to the boys if I can."

"Of course Nox."  He stood up, "Of course.  Their parents have agreed in light of the recording you sent.  They want to know if they can help.  Even Emma and Sam's parents have stopped trying to make it seem like it's your fault for all of this."

Richard Weston walked out of the fishbowl and left me in the glass walls alone and waiting while everyone who passed could see the aggitation written all over my face.  I could feel the heat and the power around me.  I was suprised no one was trying to tell me to calm down.

# Jeffery

The first boy came into the fishbowl with Richard's arm around his shoulders.  "Jeffery Taylor, this is Nox Sétanta, he wants to talk to you."

The boys brown eyes were down cast.  He was broken on the inside.  He was the younger of the two boys, his records said he was 11 and the youngest in his family.  The last child, their baby and his parents didn't see how broken this boy was.

He sat down across the table from me with his arms in front of him and his head hung.  Richard stood behnd him and I frowned up at the older man.  "Can we speak privately?  This isn't for anyone elses ears.  Survelinece has been turned off.  No one needs to be in on this conversation."

I was mostly saying it for Jeffery's benefit.  But Richard nodded and headed for the door.  "Jeffery I'll be right outside."

The boy didn't turn to see his headmaster off, nor did he look up or have much reaction at all.  I kinda wished Dev was here with me.  He could read his thoughts.  It was funny that I thought of the rockstar bartender.  He was cute, and he tasted ...  I had to focus.

The chair squeaked as I got up.  The polished wood of the table slide against my fingers in a smooth motion while I walked around to sit next to Jeffery.

I didn't hold out my had to the boy, I simply said, "Hi."  He shifted in his seat and the creeking sound of his chair was the only sound that returned.

"Can I tell you a story?"  I asked him.

The brown eyes lifted a little and he looked at me through short eye lashes with curiousity.  "When I was five I was afraid to go to sleep at night.  I saw images of fire and my mother throwing things at me.  I saw Garrett in my mind trying to make me spark.  I didn't feel it until I was older.  Marks weren't left, but I always woke with fear.  And then I started to see Dr. Silverman and she helped me the best she could."

His eyes light up as they lifted to mine at the mention of Dr. Silverman.  "Has she helped you?"

"No." He shook his head, but he smiled.  "I saw her a few weeks ago, she was nice."

"She is."  I agreed however mad I was at her, she was still a great therapist.

"Are you going to keep seeing her?"

"No."  Some of that light was gone from his eyes while he continued, "My parents say I'm not crazy.  I don't need to talk to a shrink."

"Just because you see a shrink doesn't make you crazy."

"You see a shrink."  Jeffery blurted out.

I laughed.  "Are you implying I'm crazy?"

"Aren't you?"  He asked.   He pointed to my hair and my hands.  "You bring in people for trials.  Are you too afraid to kill something that hurts people?"

"I'm not afraid to kill people who hurt people."

"Why didn't you kill Garrett then when you had the chance."  I could feel his hatred of me in that moment.  If I'd let the fire burn he'd have been saved.  "That wasn't an accident.  Everyone knows it.  You tried to kill him.  Why ddin't you finish it."  He fell to his knees in front of me, the tears were flowing and I didn't know what to do so I told him the truth.

"I was six.  I was afraid.  Why did you tell anyone he was hurting you.  It could have saved Emma and Sam's torment?"  I asked.

He looked up at me.  The horror in his brown eyes was plain and raw and I reached down and pulled him against me in a hug.  I whispered, "Because you were afraid, and he told you if you said anything he'd hurt you worse.  So you kept quiet.  Like we all did.  Every one of us who was hurt by him stayed quiet.  We let it happen to everyone after us.  But no more Jeffery."  I pulled him away from by the arms and held him but I needed to see his face.  "No more kids will be hurt by Garrett.  That means you, or me, or anyone else."

"You know how to shield from telepaths and such?"  I asked cautiously.

He nodded.  "I can help you extend that protection to your dreams if you allow me to."

"No.  My parents don't think I'm having dreams."

"But you are.  You know me from them.  We've never met before."

He sighed.  "I know but I'm not crazy."

Venatori fucking parents!  "You'd rather get beaten every night?"

All blood from Jeffery's face fled, he looked sick to his stomach and whispered, "No one knows.  I hide it."

I nodded.  "I know, I did too until after I graduated." I took his hand and snaked it around my back.  I didn't want him to see the years of abuse, but his fingers froze on my back when he felt the mangled mess and he started to cry.  I was still frozen from the touch.  My fingers were like ice against my skin and his.  He looked up at me and wrapped his arms around my neck and cried.  I held him close.  I whispered, "I think I can make him stay away if you let me.  He won't hurt you again."

There was a slight nod against my neck and I closed my eyes and pulled the boy into my lap and I held him tight while he cried.  Why the fuck did no one help these kids?  Why didn't they help me?  I reached for the pack magic again and let it flow through me.  I knew it was pack.  I didn't know how.  But I extended it to the boy in my arms and I felt him gasp against my neck.

We sat there for the remainder of the hour on the floor with my back against the plate glass wall in silence.  When Richard knocked on the glass Jeffery jumped but when he looked at me he smiled.  He seemed lighter more alive.  He leaned down and whispered, "Thank you.  I can feel it working already."

"I'm glad.   You might not want to tell your parents."

He laughed.  "I won't.  They think you are crazy."

I stood up and offered him my hand and he took it with a firm shake.  "I might be a little crazy."

He smiled and snickered too.  "I am glad you are."

The boy went with Richard back to Dae'lin's office and I sat down in the chair again.  It was best not to be threatening when meeting new people and I didn't want to scare the next one any more than he already was.

# Marvin

Richard brought the second boy in and introduced us in much the same way.  Marvin Thomas was very different form Jeffery.  Where the other boy had been quiet and timid Marvin was the exact opposite.  He was wore a leather cut and his hair was spiked.  He had tattoos all up his arms.  The idea of doing that to myself made me shiver, but the boy seemed to thrive on the biker motif.  He sat down and the chair squeaked loudly under the mucscle weight.  He was a big boy.

He looked at me with dead brown eyes.  There was no life in them, he reminded me of Garrett.  "I'm not going to get all weepy and hug you like that pansy in there."

I nodded but didn't get a chance to say anything as Marvin continued in his tough guy voice.  "I ain't got no problem you can help me with."

But I could see the fear in his eyes.  He hid behind the mask, the same as I did.  I grinned at him.  I could play this game too.  "That's fine.  I still want to talk."

"About what?"  His eyes dropped.  He'd failed to intimidate me and make me back off.  I could see the gears turning and the weaves around him darting around.

There was one thing about these three kids that I noticed, all of them had better control that most adults over the patterns.  Even in their fear and their anger they kept them constant.  I smiled at him.  "About what Garrett did to you when you were a kid."

"He didn't do anything."  The lie came out harsh.  His eyes darted to the sides to see if anyone was around to listen.

"No one can listen in.  I turned survelince off myself and shielded the controls with air, so unless they've broken my pattern, which I'd know about and they haven't, no one can hear what we say."  I confided in Marvin.

"He didn't do anything."  Marvin tried to sound convincing but I could still hear the fear in his voice.  It was much like mine.

"So he didn't make you see him hitting you in your head.  He didn't take control of your gift and beat you with it while you slept."

The blood left his face when he heard my words.  "No."  He chocked out.  He was going to lie even until the very last strike.

I shrugged.  "You can say that all you want, it doesn't make it true. I know the truth.  And I think I can keep him from you.  If you let me."

There was a glimmer of hope in his dead eyes.  But he stayed stern faced and scowled at me.  "Does it require me getting all weepy and clingy?"

I shook my head.  "I don't even have to touch you."

That made the boy's scowl fade a litle around the edges.  He wasn't going to hurt himself anymore trying to hid his emotions behind it.  "Is that a yes?" I asked.

He nodded.  And did the same thing I'd done three other times today.  I wove my connection around him.  I may not be able to protect myself from Garrett, but I sure as hell would do it for these.  I needed to talk with Adrian still, but I knew the kids were safe.  They'd never be hurt by Garrett again.  No one would touch them again.



# The Missing Boy

My day ended with Dae'lin sending me home early.  Apparently extending my power the way I had drained my energy.  I was dragging.  My brain stopped functioning and I was just being rather dimwitted.  Which some might say is normal, but when Dae'lin notices I'm screwing up she sends me home.  It's better that way.  And it's not like I have that pressing of a job at the moment anyway.  It was al just paper work.  I hated not being in the field.

But it let me deal with Garrett in the quickest form possible.  But not when I'm wiped out completely.  Head to desk, falling asleep on the keyboard wiped out.

I would pay for it later, but when I came home I laid down on the couch.  Sage found me there a few hours later asleep.

Next thing I remembered was him shaking me awake with a wry grin on his face.  "You're home early."

"Added my protection to two boys.  I think I did too much and my magic isn't happy."  I said as I sat up.  I asked, "Did you and Dorian have any luck finding the last kid?"

He shook his head.  "Still nothing more.  I've got my resources scanning for faces all over the city.  So far nothing.  If it's linked to Garrett we should see them here somewhere."

I sighed.  "Not if he left the City."

"He's Venatori and a teenager still.  You guys aren't allowed out until you are 18."  Sage said with every ounce of confidence he had.  He'd been learning a lot about my world from Dorian.  This little project bringing my boyfriend and mentor closer together.  How sweet!

I grinned at Sage.  "You're cute when you're all smart like that."

Which brought on the blush I loved to see on his skin.  It was such a difference between Sage in the bedroom and Sage out here.  He knew what he wanted in the bedroom.  But out here he was more afraid of who he was, of what he knew.  He was two different people.  Maybe even three because I didn't get to see the hacker side of him.  He was calm and collected when at his computer.  There was no blushing, no uncertainty.

He sat down next to me and pressed a kiss to my cheek.  "I did want to tell you something though."

"You can tell me anything."

He pressed me down against the couch and smiled down as he let his weight down.  I was sandwiched between the coushins below and Sage's body.  Things were getting steamy and that was never something Sage did on his own.  I wondered what had gotten into him.  That was when I noticed the soft scent of roses on his skin.  He'd see Dee again.  But I didn't smell Dev. I felt a stab of disappointment across my body and Sage must have felt it too because the look in his eyes changed.  "What's wrong?"

"Nothing.  I just smelled Dee on you and not Dev."

His blush was endearing but it was also a tale-tell sign he was uncomfortable.  He moved to get off of me and I wrapped my arms around his back and hooked his legs with mine.  He wasn't going anywhere.  I thrust my pelvis against his and he groaned against my neck.  "What did you want to tell me?" I asked.

"I found my brother."

"That's good news."  But Sage didn't act like it was good news, he was hiding his fact against my neck.  "What's wrong Sage?"

He tried to move again but I wouldn't let him.  "I...  Let me go."  The command in his voice made my body ache and I let him go without hesitation.  My arms fell to the side, one hanging off the couch and I released his legs from mine while he got off the top of me and stood on the other side of the coffee table.  He looked down at me as I moved to sit up with my hands hanging between my knees clasped together.  I didn't look up at him any more than a quick glance to make sure he wasn't mad at me.

He frowned.  "I told you I couldn't help you before because I didn't do that anymore.  That was a lie.  I don't always tell people when I crack their system.  My brother's case being one of them.  And I didn't want to take the chances of getting caught.  I trust you Nox.  But your people.  I don't know if I trust them."

I nodded.  "So you lied to me.  You actually do black hat still?"  I could understand his problem.  But he lied to me.  Said he didn't want to compromise himself.  I tried not to let the anger boil inside of me.  I hated being lied to but he was doing it for a decent enough reason but still he lied to me...

Sage answered quietly, "Yeah.  But if they found out.  I'd go to jail."  His voice broke was pleading.

"Why tell me now?"  I asked.

"Adam wants to come by and meet you."

I shrugged, "Whatever, Sage.  Your house.  Invite whoever you want."  I stood up and walked up to the his bedroom and changed into some gym clothes.

Downstairs at the bottom of the steps Sage sat holding my phone in his hand with my keys.  He at least knew how to stop me from leaving.  "I'm sorry I lied to you."

I shrugged.  "I'll deal.  I need to go for a run."

He handed me my phone and keys but didn't let go.  "I'll give it a while before I invite him over, but I just wanted to say, I want you to feel like this is your house too."

I sighed.  "I know.  You want me to move in."

"Don't you?"  he asked.

"I'm here every night.  My clothes are almost all here."  I sighed.  We were having this fight again.

"Nox, please just move in all the way.  No more studio apartment.  I want you here with me - always."  Sage pleaded.

"I am here.  Fae's here, Drake's here.  Even Matt lives here when he can.  I keep telling you I'm working on it.  My things are here.  The apartment will go away once the stupid committee decides how much they want to pay me."

"I'm sorry."  Sage sighed and let go.

I felt bad for getting upset with him.  I put my phone in my pocket and put my fingers under his chin to make him look at me.  "I'm here.  I need to cool off.  I'll be fine.  I'll be home in an hour or two.  Invite your brother wheneever you want to Sage. I'll be back.  I love you."

The last three words hit home for Sage the hardest his eyes brightened and he smiled at me.  "I love you too."  Sometimes I wondered how we were going to get along when we both were too peas in a pod.  So much the same, and yet so different.

# Running into Dev

Running was always theraputic.  The ability to just get lost in my mind.  I've always been a fan of working out, it's a go to thing to do but when I need to think I run.  So I run every night before I make dinner.  It's a habit I started in school and have just been doing since.

It allows me to think about the day.  Process the stresses and push it into my legs and arms, and moving through the city streets.  I ran the same circuit everyday so when I saw Devin coming out of a building that I passed by everyday I had to stop.  He kept popping into my head and now there he was.  I grinned and I ran up beside him as he walked in the direction I was going.  I was a little out of breath but I managed, "Fancy meeting you here."

He glanced over to me and smirked.  "Fancy that.  Are you stalking me?"  He joked.

"I was out running."

"I see that."  He said with amusement in his voice.  "I was heading to Aspect, covering for a friend."

I nodded.  "That why I've never run into you before?"

"I suppose.  Could be I was waiting for you to run by?"  He said with a sparkle in his eyes and I stopped.

"You've been waiting for me?"  I asked a little dumbfounded.

"There has been this pretty boy running past my windows for months now.  I didn't recognize you at the club.  Your movements aren't the same.  But I see the same grace as when you are dancing.  The long clean strides.  Dee thought I was crazy watching the pretty boy run by everyday.  Never even bothering to get his name and his number."  Dev laughed.  "And it turns out he's the boyfriend of one of our lovers."

I felt my heart sink.  "One of them?  You have other lovers?"  I asked.  I don't know why I should be disappointed but I was.  People like this weren't into manogomany.  Hell until a few weeks ago I wasn't either.  It wasn't until Sage shared with me desire to watch that I knew I only wanted to be with him.  Sharing was not something I really wanted to do but Sage didn't want to share with just anyone so I was open to the idea.  I was okay with him being with someone else.  I just wasn't sure I needed to be in that kinda life style.

Devin frowned.  "You project a lot."

"Wait you heard all that?"  I asked and frowned.

"Sorry.  Yeah.  If you are having doubts about this, we don't have to."  Devin sounded disappointed.

"No it's fine.  I was reflecting on the idea that I didn't want that kinda life, not that I wasn't open to sharing my lover.  I didn't think that you guys would have had other pairs, or other singles.  That's all.  No worries."

Dev's laugh was hearty and it made me smile.  I liked hearing him laugh.  "I should have phrased that differently.  He's one of my lover's boyfriends.  Not our lovers meaning we have multiple extras.  The last guy who shared our bed left to go be with a girl he'd met in Maraco.  She wasn't into the whole polyamourous relationship.  We've never actually had another couple.  But Sage came looking for me at the club a few weeks back.  He's not a very good flirt but he tried.  And then we ran into each other at paint ball, had a drink and we decided to go for a movie.  I intended it to be just me and him, but Dee refused to let me go alone.  I knew Sage was looking for another guy to fill his bed, not a couple.  But he and Dee hit it off.  They hang out more than I hang with them these days.  They have this board game thing they like.  I get so bored when they go one about it. I don't know why he doesn't bring you along."

"I've been working, he's been meeting up with you guys during the day and I can't get out of it."

Dev shook his head.  "He wasn't ready to share you.  He's afraid you'll leave him."

I laughed.  "And yet he's the one who's out looking for a third."  It was ironic.

We turned around the corner and stopped at an alley side door and I looked up and smiled at the camera and stopped my slow jog I'd been doing. It was pointless now.  I would walk the rest of the way home.  We were at the employee entrance for Ascpet, we'd talked the whole way to his shift.  Dev smirked at me.  "You and I should hang.  No sex without the others, but no one said we can't get to know each other."

I laughed.  "Are you asking me out on a date?"

Dev smirked.  "Maybe."

"What did you have in mind?"  I wanted to kiss him.  I could almost feel the touch of his skin on mine and the weight of his body on mine.

"Do you do that on purpose?  You'd make a lousy hunter all those thoughts."  He asked.

I shook my head.  "Sorry."  I pulled my shield around me and sighed at the mental drain it was.  I hated being a rock.  I hated not lettng my emotions show.

Dev's eyes went wide.   "Fuck me.  Okay.  Yeah.  Don't do that."

I blinked at him in confusion I wasn't sure what he meant and he seemed to understand because he clarified for me, "Don't block that hard.  I mean you were there all lust and desire and then the next second completely gone.  I don't mind hearing you.  Most people don't like it though but I can't help but listen to you.  Never happened before."

"What do you mean?"  I asked as I let my shields down.  I'd be more careful but up the walls a little more each day until it became natural to shield more.

"No don't shield more.  It's okay.  I see it hurts you now to hold the shield while you aren't hunting a telepath."

"You saw that," I sighed.

"I know what you are, Nox."  He ran his fingers over my right temple and the tattoo.  "My folks registered with your headquarters when we moved here.  My dad was a telepath too.  My mom didn't know, she thought it was just lost kid registry, didn't realize my dad registered too.  Dee doesn't know though.  So your bounty hunting story will have to stick around until you are ready to tell the truth.  I know it's hard when you kill people like us for a living."

"I do not kill people for a living."

Dev laughed.  "So I've heard.  I've asked around.  There are a few vampires who come into the club and when I asked if they knew this tall Venatori with a scar on his cheek they all asked if he painted his nails and dyed his hair.  They told me your name before Sage introduced you.  Said you were Il Cane's pet Venatori."

"I'm not her pet.  But they don't know that.  We just work together when necessary."  I said.

"Il Cane's not someone you mess around with is she?"  Dev asked, "The vamps all shut up when I asked any other questions about you."

I grinned at him, "So stop asking around and ask me what you want to know."

"I don't have many nights off, you sure you can't get away for lunch?"  Dev asked.

"I can get away for lunch.  We could meet at Bonnie's?" I said.  We were setting a date - one where sex wasn't even on the menu.

"I can do tomorrow at noon.  I'll have a bout an hour and a half before I need to be at work that day.  Expecting a shipment and it's my turn to come in early."

"Sounds good."  I smiled at him and gave him a little wave, but he caught my hand and pulled me close.  "I said no sex, but I'm not about to let you go without kissing you."

I smiled as he pressed his lips to mine.  He tasted sweet like candy and I wandered what he'd been eating before he came to work.  He bit my bottom lip playful and I let out a small moan.  Dev pulled away from me and waved, "I'll see you tomorrow Nox."

"Tomorrow Dev."  I took off at a jog backwards before turning around and running back to Sage's.  It wasn't far and I was suprirsed how close it was.

# Takeout

I had a date.  And not with Sage.  When I walked into the house, I could smell Italian food being warmed in the oven.  Sage had ordered out.  I walked into the kitchen dropping my keys and phone in the dish by the door where I kept them.  There was an identical one upstairs in our bedroom.

Sage was hovering over the oven while we warmed the food.  I cleared my throat and he looked up at me.  "I ordered out."  He said as he went back to his watching the food warm.  He'd burnt one too many meals so he hovered now.

"I can smell it.  Why?  I would have made something."

Sage grinned at me.  "I wanted you to relax.  I'm sorry."  His grin had faded to a frown as he apologized to me.

I shrugged, "I'm okay.  Told you I needed a run."  I shook my head, "You'll never guess who I ran into on my run."

"Who?" he asked with a smile on his face.

"Dev."

Sage stood up and his grin returned.  "Where at?"

"Outside his building.  He had an early shift.  Why didn't you tell me I ran past their place everyday?"  I asked.

"I didn't think about it.  From the grin on your face it was a good adventure."

I smiled.  "We are going to have lunch tomorrow.  Me and him.  Get to know each other."

Sage smile and went back to his hovering over the food until the timer went off.  He reached for the oven mitts and opened the door to pull our dinner out.  The boys would be here soon.

I added while he set the hot dishes on pot holders.  "You don't mind?"

He shook his head.  "We have an open agreement right?"  I nodded and he smiled at me, "So why would I care.  You can see whoever you want."

"Sage, you know I don't want to see whoever I want."  I sighed, "I just want to see you."

Sage walked around and put his hand on me hips and pressed me up against the counter.  "And I want to watch you.  And you need to like them too don't you?"

I sighed and nodded then pressed a kiss to his lips.  "Yeah I guess.  But I'm only doing it for you."

Sage laughed, "No you aren't.  You like Dev.  I can see it.  He likes you too.  He told me."

"I kinda figured that out when he said he's been watching me run past his building for a while now."

Sage grinned.  "I'd forgotten about that.  I was there one day when you were on your scheduled run.  He went down stairs with a raspberry iced tea and waited for you to run past.  Dee said he could keep a clock by it.  That he knew when you were out of town too."

"Has he been spying on me?"  I asked.

Sage shook his head, "I don't think so.  You said he's a telepath, maybe your thoughts are that stray."

"They are." I sighed.  "I'm not sure I like that he knows that much about me."

Sage pressed his lips to mine.  "Yes you do, Nox.  You want someone to read that pretty little mind of yours.  Someone to know exactly what you need and want."

I cocked my head at him, "Is that why you are pushing Dev?  Because you think you can't live up to what I need."

Sage frowned, "I know I can't Nox.  You are like this enigma.  You tell me everything but I don't know how to deal with it.  I need help taking care of you.  I don't want you to leave me because I fail at the only thing you need from me."

"I don't need anything from you Sage.  Just you."  I sighed and pushed Sage away gently so I could leave.  "I need a shower."



# My Wolf Boy

Our night was strained even after my shower.  Matt came for dinner with news that there was a guy at the Academy who liked him.  Sage cautioned him against guys like Tim.  And Matt reassured Sage that no one was going to do that to him again.  Somewhere in the woods Matthew Davenport had gained a spine.  I loved watching him grow.  Of the boys he was probably the one I dotted on the most.  Mostly because he didn't live with us permanently and he had a bad home life.

Both Sage and I understood the loss of parents.  We both understood that Matt needed that little bit extra attention.  Even though it was also the same with Faelen.  But Fae wasn't letting us in.  He curled around Drake at night when he couldn't spend the night with Matt.  Fae found himself alone in bed when Drake grew too hot. Which was becoming an occurance more often than not.  I'd taken Drake to the infimary and they said he was fine.  He wasn't even running a fever.  But he was hot to the touch and Fae was already hot blooded.  We didn't know what was going on.  I had a feeler out for the Dragon council but so far nothing had come from it.

Faelen was curled up in his bed when I checked on them and he smiled at me.  "Nox?" He whispered.  "Those kids you brought in to the pack.  They are like you?"

"Yes."  I said as I laid down next to him.  He curled in against me.

"Am I like you?" He asked.

"You are more like me than those other kids are.  We come from broken homes, all of us do.  You, me, Sage, Drake, and even Matt.  We all have at least one parent how's passed on.  Those other kids had bad things happen.  Like you and me and Sage  and you get the picture."

Faelen rolled over and looked me in the eyes.  "Will they come live with us too?"

I shook my head.  "No they have parents who love them dearly and wouldn't want them to leave them. Would you want them to leave that?"

Faelen smiled and shook his head.  "So no more kids for a while?"

I laughed.  "Just the three of you for now.  But you know that won't be forever, right?"

He nodded.  "I just want to get used to my new home before I have to be the big brother."

I hugged the boy, "Fae you are a great big brother, Drake loves you."

"He likes Matt better."  Faelen confided.

"Nah.  Matt is just better with people.  Drake likes spending the night with you.  You play with him and you are here for him."  I hugged the wolf to my body and took a bit sniff of the forest smell.  Each one of the boys was comforting in their own rights now.  They were growing on me, their smells becoming home, mixing with Sage's in his house.  It truly was becoming our house.


# Apologies

I left Fae to his slumber with a kiss on the forehead and went into our bedroom.  Not Sage's, not mine, ours.  He was siting on the end of the bed taking of his socks.  He didn't look up as I stood in the doorway watchng him.

"I'm sorry."  I said.  "I'm moving things along as fast as I can.  All the furniture I intend to sell back to the Venatori.  So the next person who moves in will have furnishings.  There is nothing at my place that I want."

Sage looked up at me and frowned, "There are coffee mugs stil there."

I laughed.  "There are three still in the apartment.  Jace likes to come by and make coffee.  Those mugs he has given me every birthday for the past five years.  I've broken one, brought one here and the other three are in that cupboard to stay.  I don't need a whole set."

Sage frowned.  "I thought that was the point of them?"

I shook my head.  "Nope.  Jace didn't remember what he got me, so he gets me a coffee mug.  Even though Mia gets my real present every year."

"The chocoloate cake."

I nodded.

"Is it bad he's predictable?" Sage asked.

"Is it bad I'm predicatble?"

Sage shook his head.  "No.  Maybe one day he'll get this."

"He's never going to get us.  And he's never going to be happy once he finds out that you were looking for another couple and you didn't think to include him."

Sage frowned.  "I thought..."

I interrupted, "I'm not having sex with Jace - ever.  But that doesn't mean he won't like it."

Sage sighed with releif.  "I wasn't excluding him and Mia.  I like Jace well enough, he doesn't like me too well.  But if you could have I would have.  I mean that was just perfect wasn't it.  But you won't so I didn't even think about it."

I smiled.  "It's alright, Sage.  I knew why.  I'm just saying if he ever ends up meeting Dev and Dee or whoever we settle on to fill out the ranks of our family here, then he won't be happy about it either which way."

Sage sighed.  "I'm sorry if I made that worse."

I sat down next to Sage and kissed his cheek.  "Jace will be Jace, don't worry about it."

Sage kissed pushed me backwards in the bed and laid down next to me.  "I'm sorry about before too.  I just want you to be happy here."

"I'm happy here.  I'm happy with you."

Sage climbed on top of me and pressed his lips to me.  "You happy with Dee and Dev?"

I grinned up at him.  "I like Dev.  And I think Dee and I can find something in common.  Do you like them?"

"Yeah.  Dee is nice.  I like her we have a lot in common.  And Dev is fun.  But I like him mostly cause he likes you."  Sage pressed his body to mine.  "I'm sorry about lying to.  I'm sorry about pushing moving in.  I forget you live the way you do."  He pressed into me and I pulled him close to me.  "Nox.  I want..."

"Love, I'm yours.  You don't need to ask."

He kissed me and pulled at my shirt while bit on my neck.  "I don't want to take anything from you, Nox."

"You aren't love, I gave it to you already and I'll keep giving it to you."

We became one.  Hands and mouths all over.  Clothes left slowly as we rubbed against each other.  The best part of being with Sage was he liked it slow.  He was a tenative lover but he knew exactly what I loved.  His body pressed against mine as he kissed me long and deep.  His teeth biting into my lip, his tongue soothing it the mark.  I enjoyed the slow press of his hips to mine.  Our naked bodies fit together and we weren't even into the best part of sex.

Sage pushed me down and pressed inside me.  My love liked it slow and he drove me crazy as he moved inside me.  I wanted to scream but the boys were across the hall.   Sage covered my mouth with his hand and I groaned against him.  He knew what I wanted to be loud.  I screamed against his hand had and he groaned against my neck as he came inside me and I followed him only moments later as he thrust through his orgasm.  "Fuck, love." I said when he removed his hand from my mouth.

Sage pulled me against him and covered me up, "Sleep, Nox."

# Furious Demon

Sleep came but it was interrupted by a phone call.  Sage answered and I barely heard anything.  But I felt him uncurl from me and kiss my cheek, "I have to go to work.  There is an emergency."

I mummbled something but even I didn't understand it as I drifted back to sleep.  The warmth of my bed lessened.  The smell of Sage faded and the darkness overwhelmed me.

The darkness was thick.  The fog rolled in and I could feel it against my limbs.  It was cold and wet and when it envloped my face it was suffocating.  I choked on the fog.  The red glow came from the east and grew brighter.  My heart was racing, my palms were sweating.  I was frozen in place.

The voice echoed in the darkness, "You have been a bad boy."

There was no warning when the first lash hit. I screamed.  It burned, it radiated through my body.

The blows landing without pause.  One after the other my skin tore from my body.  My throat was raw.

I felt a hand on my shoulder.  It pulled me into the light.  I saw a familiar face and he kissed me and whispered, "Wake up pretty boy."

I opened my eyes and I felt my body stuck to the sheets of our bed, but Sage wasn't here.  Where was Sage?

I reached for my phone and texted Sage.  "I need you up here."

I tried to sit up and I couldn't my body felt broken.  I wrapped myself in the elements and hoped it helped.  My phone rang and I picked it up and looked at the number but didn't recognize it.  I answered it anyway.  "What time is it?"

"Nox?  Are you alright?"

I blinked at the phone.  And Sage came into the room and he was typing on his phone, "What..."  He looked at the bed and rushed over.

I asked, "Dev?"

"Are you alright?"

Sage took the phone.  "Dev, no he's not okay.  How did you know to call?  Can I ask a favor I know it's late."

"Yeah, I just got in, was resting my eyes and felt his fear.  What do you need Sage?"

"Can you come help him?  It's a mess and I really can't.  There's a hacker group trying to get into one of our systems and I need to work."  Sage had moved into the bathroom to get a towel.

I heard Dev on the other end of the phone agree, and said he'd be over soon.  I tried to sit up again and Sage was pushing me back, "Nox, you aren't healed yet.  Don't move.  Dev, will come help but I'm not going anywhere till he gets here."

"I'll be okay.  I don't want him to see me like this."  I said.

Sage kissed me.  "Nox.  He'll see you like this one day if I have my way so he might as well know alright. What happened?"

I sat up with his help.  "I don't know.  You left, I had a nightmare.  Worst than I ever had before."

There was a knock at the door.  "Dev's here." I said.

Sage grinned, "You're hearing is handy sometimes.  I'll go let him in.  You okay?"

"I hurt but yeah I'm fine."

Sage pressed his lips to mine.  "I'll be right back."

# Dream Walker

Sage walked into the bedroom with Dev on his heels as I stood up.

"Holy fuck!"  Dev exclaimed, "What the fuck happened? I thought that was just a dream."

Sage looked at him, "What was a dream?"  Sage was pressing me back down onto the sticky blood covered sheets.  "Nox, sit, your back isn't healed yet."

Dev looked at my back and his hand jerked back with blood.  "Fuck!" He looked at Sage, "I got it from here Deadshot."  He pressed a kiss to his lips and Sage blushed.  "Go do your hacking thing, I got our pretty poy."

Sage looked at me and then back to Dev, "You sure.  This is a lot."

Dev grinned at Sage.  "Deadshot, if you can handle this.  I can handle this."

"I'm okay, love.  I promise.  Dev can help me clean up."

Sage sighed then wrapped his arms around me and gave me a hug then a simple kiss on the check.  "Call me if you need me."

I nodded.  "Thanks love."

I watched Sage leave the bedroom.  He was immediately on his phone tapping away.  Dev turned back to me.  "That's a lot of blood for your back.  Let me help you take the shirt off."

I sighed and just sliced it off with a razor of air and Dev's eyes went wide.  "Same thing that does it is actually useful."

Dev put his hands on my shoulders and turned me.  "Your back is fine."

"I healed it."  I sighed.  I turned around and looked at all the blood on the bed.

Dev looked across the bed as we stripped the bed of blood soaked sheets.  "The mattress is ruined."

I shrugged not really.  "Its not the first time it's happened.  I've cleaned it before."  I wove some air with some earth and fire and the stain lifted right out.

Dev laughed, "You've done that before."

"A few times.  This is the worst it ever been though."  I said as I went out into the hall to get fresh sheets to make the bed with.

Dev helped me make the bed and I looked at the time on my phone it wasn't even midnight. "What did you do?"  I said as I laid down and pulled the sheets over me and patted the bed next to me.  "Can you stay?"

He looked at me then looked down the hall.  "You're boys?"

I pulled my pillow under my head and closed my eyes.  "I need to sleep.  I'm drained."  I grinned at him.  "Quite literally, sex is so far beyond me right now."

Dev laughed as he tugged off his shoes and jacket.  "I meant, what are they going to think if they find me in your bed?"

I shrugged.  "I'll tell you what Sage told me when I protested you seeing me like this.  If he gets his way they'll see it eventually."

"His way?"

I nodded.  "I think he intends this to go on a good long while.  I like the idea myself."

Dev pulled his jeans off and crawled into bed next to me.  "I've not spent the night in a guys bed in a long time."

"We'll you are only the second guy who's I've shared a bed with who wasn't my best friend without having sex."  I grinned at him.  "But next time we do this I think we'll be having sex before cuddling."

"You want to cuddle with me?"

"Yes, I want to.  I don't know what you did in my dream.  Maybe you can keep it away, maybe not but touch always helps with Sage when I'm having a particularly bad day."  I said as I moved closer to Dev.  He laid on his back and wrapped his arm around me and I froze when his hand touched my bare back.  My pulse was high and my palms were sweating and I could feel myself shaking against him.

Dev's fingers splayed across the scars on my back.  His voice was low I barely heard it at first, "This ain't a song for the broken-hearted / No silent prayer for the faith-departed." I focused on Dev's low voice, "I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd / You're gonna hear my voice / When I shout it out loud."

I calmed a little with each word he sang.  He hummed, "is it helping?"

I looked up at him and smiled.  "Never had a guy sing me to sleep before.  But yeah it helps.  What did you do, Dev?"

"When?" He asked.

"In my dream."

"Sometimes when I go to sleep, I sometimes find others dreams.  It's how I found Dee actually.  I felt fear.  I was drawn to here to your fear.  I didn't know it was you.  I saw a dark figure beating on a man, I didn't know it was you until I pulled you out.  I don't know how I do this it just happens."

"Normally I'd be freaking out about what you can do.  But I think that fear I dealt with finally. I don't know if you'll keep the nightmares away like Sage, but maybe if it happens again you can pull me back out."

Dev hummmed and picked up back singing, "It's my life / It's now or never / I ain't gonna live forever / I just want to live while I'm alive."

I smiled and pulled up closer to him and took a deep breath of his skin and smiled he smelled of mellow citrus.  I closed my eyes and tried to drift off to sleep as I listened to him sing me to sleep with his hand rubbing small circles along the scars of my back.

# Shields

I woked up to my alarm and Dev turning it off.  He rolled over and smiled at me.  "You wake up to fucking early pretty boy."  He pressed a kiss to my lips.  "You get up, do your thing, I'm gonna stay here a while?"

I laughed.  "I don't know how I'm going to be ablt to top our lunch date if this is the first date.  I mean, you've got me half naked already, in a bed.  Lunch is going to be such a let down."

Dev smirked.  "I'm sure we'll manage.  Unless you plan on staying, get up so I can sleep."  He shoved me.

I sighed.  "If I wanted to stay?"

Dev pulled me close and kissed me.  "I think we can think of something."

Our bodies felt good against each other.  I could feel his errection against mine.  Dev rolled over on top of me and smiled.  "I think we need to stop now."  His body pressed against me and I hummed in agreement.

I grinned up at him, "What should we talk about then?"

Dev rolled to the side and but I stopped his movement with my hands on his hips.  "Stay.  No more, just stay?" I asked.

Dev redistributed his weight on top of me and leaned his head on to his hand and looked down at me.  "I have a serious topic if you want to discuss it."

"How serious?  Being on top of me going to be problem?"  I grinned up at him.

"I have another skilled, part of the dream walking."  Dev confided in a quiet whisper.  "While you slept I took a look at your shields."

"You can do that?"

"It's part of what draws me people.  I saw Sage's shield downstairs while he dozed.  His is strong.  Drake's is perfect and Fae's is a little weak but it's getting stronger.  Your's?"  He pressed his lips to mine.  "Your's is fucked up."  He smiled at me, "It's a tangled mess.  It has black veins keeping your shield from completely closing.  I've never seen anything like it.  I might be able to do something about that."

"Like what?" I asked.

"Strengthen it, get rid of those veins would be best. I'm not sure how yet, but I think I can help.  I've helped Dee's a little, her's is impentrable.  Nothing in and nothing out, everyone lets something out it's human nature."  He looked at me and smirked.  "Not that you are human."

I pressed my lips to his and whispered, "Half human."  I sighed.  "I should get up.  Get a shower, clean the rest of the blood off me.  "Stay for breakfast?"

Dev grinned down at me, "Nap, and then breakfast?"  He rolled to his side but half his body was still on top of mine.  "I'll take some pancakes if you don't mind."

I rolled on top of him and looked down into his baby blues then pressed a chaste kiss to his lips. "I can manage that.  Breakfast will be ready at 6."


# Quieter

After a quick yoga routine I went upstairs to shower.  Dev's chest moved in his sleep cadance.  I stood in the doorway taking in the sight of another man in our bed.  A man my boyfriend had already slept with.  I sighed as I grabbed clean clothes and walked into the bathroom to take that shower I'd come up for.

Sage was usually asleep in the bed waiting on me to finish so he could do his thing.  But this morning he was already up.  I probably should have made him some coffee, but I figured there was a pot already on.  He'd been up awhile.  And might be up for a long while more.

My shower was quicker than usual, same with the hair and make up.  I choose two use two different blues this morning.  I'd had help from both blue eyed babes and I was more than happy to share their success.  Though I doubted either would care one way or the other.  It was a thing for me.

Dev had rolled towards the door when I exited but other than that gave no indication he was awake.  I opened the bedroom door and was going to slip out when Dev's voice startled me, "Mind if I take a shower pretty boy?"

I turned back to see Dev lounging against Sage's pillow and his hands behind his head.  I bit my bottom lip.  I'd very much like to be looking up at him like that from a very different angle.  The smirk on his face told me he'd read my thoughts.

"You are pretty easy to tempt.  And so loud."

"I'll try to be quieter."

Dev shook his head, "No.  I don't think it's you."

"What do you mean?"  I asked as I sat down on the edge of the bed.

"It's hard to explain."  I had a feeling it was not but that he didn't want to talk about it.  I leaned across the bed and kissed his lips softly.  "Thank you for your help last night.  And this morning.  And feel free to grab a shower, find something that fits, I'm sure one of us has something you can wear.  Breakfast will be ready in twenty."



# Up All Night

There was no coffee on, the pot had been turned off and was cold when I got downstairs.  Sage hadn't had any which meant he was dozing downstairs or on the verge of it. It was my first step in prepping breakfast anyway.  I needed coffee.  Comfort in a cup.

Tuesday was a simple meal, bacon and eggs.  Adding pancakes wasn't a problem.  Drake and Fae both loved them.  And I was getting better at them.  I didn't have to eat them so I could easily make it part of the everyday breakfast for the kids.

When the coffee was brewed I poured a large cup and took it downstairs.  I heard Sage's chair swivel towards to back staircase as I came down the stairs.  I wasn't making any noise that he could hear, I knew which steps squeaked.  I loved watching him hone in on coffee alone.  He didn't have super strong senses like me or those he was around, but coffee was something everyone could smell even if they hated the stuff.

I was at the bottom of the steps with my blue-eyed boyfriend staring up at me from the floor.  On the bottom step I was taller than him and he grinned up at me.  "I like this view."

I leaned down and pressed a kiss to his lips.  "Dev's in the shower told him he could find something to wear."

Sage smiled.  "You sleep okay?"

I nodded. "No more nightmares."

Sage's smile faded into a frown.  "I'm sorry about that."

I held a finger to Sage's lips.  "Shhh.  It's not your fault.  You had to work.  It's going to happen.  It's just been a while, it's like it built up or something.  Dev helped me clean up and he stayed to make sure I slept.  At the very least he could pull me out of the nightmare again."

"What?"  Sage said scratching his head then sipped at his coffee.  "Oh god, thank you.  I'm frazzled."

"Sit down, love.  I'll get breakfast done and you can take a 20 minute break.  I'm sure someone can handle it while you rest a little."

Sage nodded.  "I love you." He said it like I was saving him from great doom. "I'll get with Danny to cover me while I'm up stairs.  He'll understand."

"If he doesn't I'll bring your food down to you.  Just let me know love."  I pressed another kiss to his lips and he hummed against them.

"Mmmm, I think I missed a good morning."

I laughed, "We only kissed."

Sage pouted.  "That all?"

I raised an eyebrow and he grinned at me.  I rolled my eyes.  "I'm going to go make breakfast."

Sage had been up all night.  He was going to be up all day.  Which meant tonight was going to be a very early night for him if he could get this job taken care of tonight.  I didn't look forward to another sleepless night for him.  For both our sakes.



# Breakfast

Making pancakes was time consuming so when Dev made his way down the stairs I hadn't barely started the eggs, but there was a pile of pancakes sitting on the island waiting for everyone to eat.  But he didn't sit down, he came up next to me and poured himself a cup of coffee.  "I'd take it black but then I might not drink it and it smells too good not to drink.  Milk or cream?"

"On the door in the fridge.  Sage likes it with cream and sugar so it's always on hand."  I said letting Dev help himself.  "While you are in there grab the syrup and mascerated berries in the white bowl, please?"

"You got it."  He said with a grin.  "I think the boys were stirring upstairs."

I nodded, "Yeah, Fae gets himself and Drake up then they get ready for school."

Dev put the syrup and berries on the island and sat down.  "Damn it all smells so good.  I knew you could cook but you do this every morning?"

Fae came in with Drake racing in before him to climb up next to Dev.  "Daddy, cooks every morning.  And every night."  He said.

Dev grinned at Drake. "Do you like his food?"

Drake shook his head.  "Not all the time.  Sometimes he makes me it green things.  I'm a dragon.  I'm supposed to eat meat!"

Dev laughed, "But you need to eat your green things or you won't grow up big and strong like your Daddy."

Fae sat down next to Drake and made his plate in silence.  Dev chuckled, "You don't talk much do you Faelen?"

He shook his head and mumbled, "No sir."

"Are they all yes and no sir?"  Dev asked me with a curious look.

I shook my head.  "No.  Fae grew up in a strict pack.  You spoke when you were spoken to, you eat after your elders, what your pack leader says is law no questions asked.  He's learning I'm not quite such a strict pack leader."

Faelen laughed, "Sage has less rules than Nox."

Dev grinned at Faelen I knew he wanted to say something sarcastic I could see it on his face.  But he behaved himself.  "What rules does Nox have?"

Drake giggled, "Clean your room. Eat your vegetables."  His face squinched up into a cute little version of ew before he went on. "Put things where they belong.  Pick up your clothes.  Shoes don't go in the middle of the floor."

Dev laughed.  "Is he a neat freak?"  Dev asked the little dragon.

Drake frowned as he shook his head.  "No.  It makes him hide."

"Hide?"  Dev asked around a forkful of pancakes and syrup.

Faelen nodded.  "Nox will go into their bedroom and lock the door if there is a mess in our rooms.  Sage says it's cause he can't deal."  He looked up at me, "But says he's not mad at us.  Just can't deal with the mess."

Dev smiled at me.  "What other rules you got?"

"I'll tell you them all sometime."

"All?"  Dev asked.  "You have a list of rules?"

I shrugged and Sage came up stairs chatting on the phone with his dad.  He said into the phone, "Gotta go Danny, Nox is done cooking and everyone's eating but me.  It'll all be gone." He was frowing at the near empty island of food.

I pointed at the stove where I had a plate stacked high with pancakes and bacon and eggs just for Sage.  He sighed with relief as he put his phone in his back pocket and picked up his plate and brought it to the island next to me.  Dev was in his seat and he didn't bother pulling the other stools out from their hiding spot around the corner.  He took a bite and moaned, "Damn.  Nox.  What you do different?"

I shrugged.  "Not much, a little more sugar and vanilla this go round."

Sage pressed a syrupy kiss to my cheek and I groaned.  "These are perfect.  No more chages."

Dev laughed.  "I do have to agree.  These are perfect.  Fluffy, and sweet and I'd almost say heaven."

I felt heat rising in my cheeks and ducked my head.  It was one thing to give me an out and out compliment, this was different.

We all ate breakfast in pleasant company.



# Caught Kissing

The boys went upstairs to get ready for school.  Sage looked at me then looked at Dev grinning at me.  He asked, "So was this too much Dev?"

The smirk never faded as he shook his head.  "I got to see a Venatori Magnus work his magic without trying to kill me afterwards.  I got to curl up next to pretty boy here.  I got to rummage through the closet of my lovers with their permission.  And I got an awesome breakfast cooked for me.  Plus the added conversation of two of three boys I think I might want to get to know better."  Dev walked around the island and kissed Sage with a tender press of his lips.  "Deadshot you should get back to work now.  We'll go see a movie Sunday afternoon.  Just me and you, I promise.  You spend enough time with Dee she shouldn't drag herself along this time."

There was a pink tinge to Sage's ears and cheeks when Dev moved away from him, but I caught Dev and held him close while I took my turn kissing my love.  Sage pulled away first and smiled at me before he leaned to my ear and whispered loud enough that I knew Dev could hear too, "I want to see you kissing Dev."

Dev laughed, "As you wish."  I looked from one blue eyed boy to the other reveling in the difference in the blues.  Bright sapphire and baby blue.  I hummed to myself as Dev pulled me close and pressed his lips to mine.  I parted my lips and his tongue slipped in and explored my mouth.  I reached up behind him and pulled him in tighter against me and he let out a small moan and felt my whole body react.  Sage moaned and...

There was a loud clearing of a throat.  Sage was red as a beat and Dev was chuckling as we all pulled away from each other, hands lingering a little.

"I gotta go to work."  Sage pressed a kiss to my cheek and then one to Dev's and headed down stairs.

I asked, "You two ready?"

Fae nodded.  "Yeah.  Waitin on you."

Dev wrapped his arm around my waist, "You mind if I walk you to work?"

Drake came in and giggled, "You can walk with us.  If I can walk in the middle and you swing me."

I looked at Dev and laughed, "You heard the little man, can you handle that?"

"I think I can."  He lifted Drake up and offered Fae his hand.  The little wolf looked at Dev's hand and took it slowly.  I wrapped my arm around Fae's shoulders and kissed his forehead.  He was getting there.

# Walk to School

Dev and I walked to AU building with Drake between ours hands and he swung back and forth.  Fae was wrapped around my arm like he was afraid of Dev.  Dev smiled.  "He's alright, Nox.  Don't worry so much."

Fae looked at Dev with a shy smile and Dev grinned back.  "He worries so much about the three of you."

Drake giggled.  "He's Daddy, he's supposed to."

Dev nodded.  "Yeah I guess he is."

We didn't take the train, we should have.  The boys were going to be cutting it close to check in time.  We'd finally gotten Fae to stay in the Academy under the pretense he didn't have to spend the night.  And being a werewolf who could shift at any time they rules were bent for Fae.  It's funny that the Venatori hunt supernatural creatures but they really know nothing about them.  A teenage werewolf isn't going to just randomly shift.  But the Venatori think that all werewolves can shift into wolf form no matter their age.  Mostly because a bitten human changes no matter the age.  Could be a child, could be an adult if they survive the initial bite and infection and carry the virus that mutates them, then they change.  There are a few recorded cases of werewolves victims who should have turned but didn't turn.  They survived but didn't shift. but it's so rare it's not really well studied or documented.  Usually they are chalked up to regular wolf or dog attacks not a werewolf.  Mistaken identity.  I'm sure some Venatori is studying it.  But them maybe not.

But if you are born a wolf like Faelen was, then you shift for the first time in your early twenties.  Around twenty-two.  I think Adrian said that the earliest was 19 but that was rare and same for the top end of twenty-five.  Both instances very rare.

The AU building towered over us and Faelen reached under Drake's arms and picked him up.  "I got him.  You say goodbye to your boyfriend."  Faelen gave an all too knowing grin and kissed my cheek.

"Cheeky lad."  Dev said with a smirk.

"The fact he said that means he likes you." I sighed, "The fact that I have two and a half adopted kids doesn't bother you does it?"

Dev took my hand and pulled to the side of the building out of the way of the crowds passing to and fro on the street.  "Honestly, I thought it would be when they came home the other night.  We had plans.  But this morning proved to be different.  The boys seemed okay with the idea that you were not just a couple.  Faelen seems open to the idea."

I shrugged.  "Wolves mate for life. I don't know.  Matt's into guys only.  Faelen doesn't know what he wants.  Drake is three."

Dev added. "And you and Sage are both bi."

"No, Sage is more than pan than bi.  His last girlfriend before me was transgender man who dumped him because she wanted to date someone hotter than him - her words not mine.  No idea what she'd consider hotter than Sage."

The look on Dev's face was mocking me, "What you don't think I'm hotter than Sage?"

I grinned and ran my finger down Dev's jawline.  "There is no competition between you two.  If this is going to work there can't be."

Dev asked, "Do you want this to work?"

"I think I do."  I sighed, "It'll be harder for me with Dee.  But I want to make Sage happy.  And I think I'll enjoy getting to know you two better."

"I promised Sage a movie night, you and Dee should get together and hang out."  Dev took my phone from my pocket and handed it to me, "Unlock it so I can add the numbers for you."

I swiped the phone with nothing flashy and Dev sighed.  "You don't really care who gets into your phone?"

I smiled.  "There are other preventatives on the phone thanks to my hacker boyfriend and the paranoia of the Venatori."

"You know he doesn't call you his boyfriend?"  Dev said.

I nodded. "He doesn't like the gender specificity of it.  I'm his partner.  I'm okay with that.  And then calling my on again off again partner at work becomes weird if I said oh this is my partner.  Oh?  You get the conversation."

We stood there looking at each other.  I couldn't help the linger of my eyes on his his attire.  He was wearing Sage's jeans, they were just a little too long for him but fit his hips.  He was wearing my favorite blue shirt and it was a little tight in the chest and I couldn't keep my eyes from him.  I made myself look up into his baby blue eyes and grinned at him.  His eyes were bright and he was letting me check him out.  He asked, "You want me to spin and turn?"

I laughed.  "Would you mind?"

Dev chuckled and pushed off the wall he was leaning on and did that classic slow turn you see all the woman do when showing off their outfit.  I wanted to dance with him in that moment.  "I knew that was a rhetorical question but that thought, you haven't asked it."

"What the whole wanting to dance with you?"  I asked.  He nodded with smirk.  "One day I'd like to go dancing with you.  Not to a club.  Something more.  Sage has an embarassment quota dressing him up would be too much he'd nothing but red the whole time if I pushed beyond that."

"I think Dee is more your gal on that."

I shook my head, "You can move.  I can see it.  I'll get you to dance with me.  Maybe not soon, but we have time."

Dev shook his head.  "I can dance.  I choose not to."

"Party pooper."  I grinned at him and pulled him close by the belot loop of his jeans.  "I have to go or I'll be late and my day has already been interrupted."

Dev frowned.  "What interrupted your day?"

I kissed him softly and let him take control of it when his tongue slipped into my mouth.  He tasted of breakfast and coffee and a shiver ran through my body.  I whispered against his lips when he let me up for air, "You did.  But it's worth it."

Dev smiled.  "Alright.  I won't be mad then.  I don't want to upset the balance, Nox."

"You have already done that but it's okay.  Sage needs you and Dee and I think I do too.  I'll see you at lunch still?"

Dev nodded.  "With bells on."

I laughed.  "Can I hold you to that?"

"Maybe."  Dev pressed a kiss to my cheek and turned on his heel to walk to the nearest train station.  He turned around and waved once before I went inside the building to see about work.

# My Dad's Job

I sat down with my Dad when I got to work.  He was waiting for me.  I saw his salt and peppered brown head sticking up above the back of my chair before I got far from Dae'lin's office.  He heard me coming and swivled towards me.  "I was expecting you twenty minutes ago."

I grinned at my father.  "We walked here."

"That's a change, may I ask why?"

"A boy wanted to walk me and the boys here."  I said as I sat down the corner of my empty desk.

"Sage walked you here?"

I shook my head.  "No.  My love has been seeing a couple and he came by last night because Sage had to work and I had a nightmare worse than usual and he didn't want to leave me alone."

"A strange man stayed in the house with you and the boys?"  Kai asked in that over protective voice of a father.  And one that grated on me because he hadn't been my father when I needed it.

"Sage has been seeing him for a while.  Fae and Drake like him.  Matt too I think."

"It feels like only yesterday since I was meeting you for the first time.  Now I have a three year old grandson and two 16 year old grandsons all from the son who likes boys more than girls."

I laughed.  "I at least like girls, your other son doesn't. Don't worry about Dev, he's a good guy."

Kai frowned.  "I don't think I'll ever understand you.  You are ready to settle down but you are dating multiple people."

"That's right, Dad, you aren't going to understand it.  So don't worry about me settling down.  My relationships don't matter to you."  I didn't mean to sound so harsh but there it was.  My father didn't get a say in my love life.  He wasn't there when I needed him and he doesn't get to tell me how to live my life now.

Kai must have sensed my thoughts.  Or seen some variation of the future in those few short minutes we spoke.  He gave me a grin as wide his face and patted my leg next to him.  "Son, as long as you are happy and the boys are well taken care of."

I smiled and changed the subject I didn't want to know what he saw, I kept telling myself that I didn't believe in fate or destiny or any of those I have no choice matters, but if my father saw me happy I kinda wanted to know what it was that made me happy.  But then again, I didn't want to know.  I didn't want that pressure.  I wanted to do this on my own.  I could be happy, that's all that mattered.  "You needed my help?"

Kai inclined his head and acknowledged it was time to work.  "Yeah, I have a series of vamp killngs.  I don't think it's one vamp doing it.  They appear random and appear like they are sending a message to someone.  Can you speak with your contacts?"

I shook my head.  "Yeah, I can call Ant.  You have the paperwork?"

My dadd patted the folder sitting on my desk in front of him with his short fat fingers.  I had my mother's hands and it made me sigh.  "All right here," he said with a smile.  "I figured you'd want the details.  Emilio says that we could track them down, but if it's a message we should probably figure it out before it becomes more."  Kai snickered.  "There once was a time when we'd have just hunted the vamps.  Now in our old age, this young whipper-snapper comes along and says there might be something going on.  Emilio and I aren't getting any younger.  Hunting ain't getting any easier.  But we sure do get more badguys with you doing leg work for us."

I laughed. "I'm a hunter.  I should be out there too."

"You do more good in here."

"I'm not some fucking grunt!"  I was getting pissy.  I knew why and stood up and took a few steps around my desk then turned back.  Pacing wasn't comforting but it was the only thing I could do at the moment.

Kai stood up and his height almost matched my own.  He was in his fifty's but still looked like he was thirty something.  And he still could break me in half at any age.  "Son.  You do more good work here than you can out in the field.  You have a family to think about now. You have more contacts than anyone in this facility.  And yeah you have only a few people who come to you but Dae'lin gives you jobs here before the grunts out there get them.  This is meaningful work, son.  We all know you save who you can and give us the left overs."

I frowned.  "I'm not making any new contacts. I can't do this, Kai.  I need to be out there."

My father pulled me in and hugged me.  He never did that.  "Son.  You are making contacts, for every hunter you help do their job, you are making contacts.  Just not on the side you think you need.  You know the scariest fucking vampire in the world.  You have the founders of V&M on speed dial.  You can get in touch with the heads of two werewolf packs.  You overrode Mark Green's decree that the oldest of the Dragons could not come here.  Son.  You have the contacts you need.  Hell, you are on a first name basis with almost all of them.  Nox, that's impressive."

I shrugged and pulled out of his grip. "I hate sitting at a desk."

Kai laughed, "Come on let's go spar.  We can talk while we do."

"I have lunch at noon."

"A date", he asked and nodded confirmation as we headed for the elevator.

# Broken Bits

It was still early and the gym was full of Venatori doing their thing.  The large of the gyms in the building had several rings and Kai and I had to wait for a little while before we could get in one.  Which was okay, it allowed me to stretch and even though I got strange looks do some yoga.

My father sat next to me on the mat while I moved through each pose.  "Most of us don't do what you do."  Kaid said as stretched his legs and groin muscles.

"Most people aren't half human who get their ass kicked either."  I reminded him.

"You are a better fighter than most of the people here.  Why do you think that is?"  Kai asked.

"Because I have to work hard at what I do.  Same with everything else I do, Dad."

"Nothing comes easy for you.  It's a constant reminder that I should have been there for you."  His voice was full of sorrow and I could tell he wanted to say more, do more, and be more than I was letting him.

"What would you have done, Kai?"

"You wouldn't like men for one thing.  That's all on Dorian."

I sat down hard when Kai blamed the one person who was there for me in everything.  "Dorian has nothing to do with why I like men.  I didn't know Dorian was into men until after I had crushed on Dylan and kissed him.  Dorian confided in me then that he felt the same.  Just like I didn't make Nick gay.  He was gay before I met him.  I was just the first boy he got caught with."  I stood up and sighed.  "This is why you and I don't get along.  You piss and moan about how I would be different if you had been my father.  I got news for you Kai.  I like the man I became."

I turned and walked away from my father.  I could feel his eyes on my back and then in only a few steps my father was up and grabing my arm.  It had been silent and if I hadn't been waiting for it I might have found myself on the floor instead of flipping my father over my shoulder and looking down at him lying on the mat.  "I might have been a different person, Kai, if you raised me.  But I don't think I'd be a better man because of it.  Dorian let me think outside the box.  He encouraged it."

"He didn't care, that's why he encouraged it. He didn't care if you became a fag or the outcast.  He only cared about his image, being the only man to wrangle a resentful child.  You are just part of his image."  He spat out the words like he hated the youngest Vega.  And I suppose he did when it came to me.

I sighed.  "Dad, Dorian is a good man." I knelt down and whispered above him.  "Dorian cared more than you ever would have.  You think Nick, Marius or Tobias think you were a good father.  Even Iris and Adam have issues with you, what makes me so different than them.  They all thought you were a lousy father.  You weren't there for the children you had.  Don't think you would have made me a better person.  I'd be just like them, ignorant to the world outside.  I wouldn't know what it meant to actually protect humanity.  They don't know what it feels like to be human.  They can't even fathom the idea that not all supernatural creatures are alike.  They are people just like us.  I love Dorian like a son should love his father.  You?  I barely know.  And we always get into these arguements.  I want to love you like Dorian.  I want to take you from that dark place where I kept my father.  But you keep closing the door, slamming it in my face.  Be a good grandfather to the boys.  You will never be a good father to me."

The room had gone quiet while I said my peice to Kai.  Everyone was looking but trying not to look.  I stood up and walked away to the locerk room to get my things.  There was not going to be any sparring today.  And I knew if I stayed I was going to get the shit kicked out of me.  It would probably still happen.



# Vampire Calls

My father was notorious for pissing me off.  Today was no different.  And it always seemed to be about the same things.  You are gay.  You aren't a horrible hunter.  You can't do this.  You can't do that.  He's always bitching about Dorian.  Dorian made you gay.  Dorian did this.  He didn't do that.  I sighed as I sat down at my desk and looked through the files my father had on the vampires.  It was not much to go on but I did give Ant a call.  But he wasn't the one who picked up.  "'ey Nox.  How goes it?"

I sighed.  "Ryan.  Ant around?"

"Nope.  He's sleeping.  Cari insisted he die this day."

I sighed.  "Alright.  I have to speak with him about some vamp killings around the city.  My dad's on the case and he thinks someone is trying to send a message.  I have the photos and things.  Maybe tonight or tomorrow we can get together and discuss it."

Ryan laughed.  "I'll have Ant get with you when he can.  He'll call you or something."

"Fine. Ryan.  Tell Cari I send my regards."

"She'll love to hear her pet Venatori says hello.  Adios!"  Ryan hung up and I let the phone die.

There was lots of work to do for other people and when my alarm went off I knew I was a litle late for my lunch with Dev, thankfully it was just across the street.  I sent Dev a text, "Lost track of time, on my way, be there in five."



# Lunch with Dev

I got a text from Dev as I hit the lobby from the stairwell.  "No problem.  Not there yet either."

Neither of us were really late, but it felt good when we both showed up outside Bonnie's at the same time.  I reached for the door handle and a hand touched the smallof my back and I froze a little before there was a soft breath against my neck and the faint smell of citrus touched my nose and Dev spoke softly, "Fancy meeting you here."

"I thought we had a date, it's not fancy at all."  I grinned at him.

I opened the door and the door tinkled.  Dev walked in before me and I let the door close behind me.  Bonnie looked up from her customer she was waiting on with a smile.   The booth in the back corner was empty and I took Dev's hand and lead him to it.  Bonnie stared at our hands and she frowned.

It wasn't long before Bonnie came to our table.  Bonnie's frown was deep and it made her look much older than she was.  "What happened to Sage?"

Dev laughed.  "Sage and I are seeing each other too, Ms. Bonnie.  It's all very open, no hiding."

Her blush was bright.  "I..."

"Bonnie, I'll have my usual."

Dev grinned up at her, "Tactfully put. I'll have what he's having.  Ms. Bonnie."

Bonnie nodded.  "I'll have your drinks in a few moments.  Coffee?" she asked Dev.

"That's fine.  Cream and a sugar please."

She was gone and we were alone again.  Dev sat across from me unlike Sage who chose to sit next to me.  It was not fair to compare but I enjoyed looking at Dev and was glad he sat there.  His smirk was wide and bright and I shook my head.  "We could have a whole conversation in my head couldn't we?"

Dev laughed.  "I'd have to touch you, but yeah.  You don't shield too well."  I was about to say I can to just that Dev didn't like it but he interrupted me before I said anything at all, "I like you this way.  Most people who know what I can do think I'm a freak or they try to play guessing games, or some various other stupid trick when all they do is think I'm faking it, or it's some other kind of trick.  You understand.  And you're thoughts aren't being faked, you aren't hiding."

"If I over populate your thoughts let me know.  I can tighten my shields."  I really didn't want to have him hearing everything but I wasn't opposed to him listening.

"I try not to listen in."  Dev reached across the table and put his fingers under my chin so I would look at him.  His baby blue eyes sparkling in the sun light.  "I can't help listening to you."  He was trying to comfort me and I hadn't even realized I'd gone into reflection mode.  Maybe having a telepath around was a good thing all around.  Dev gave me a wide smile but didn't say anything.  It was hard getting used to him hearing my thoughts.  "I think I might have a solution to your problem if you want to take a chance."

"What kinda chance?" I asked.

Bonnie brought over our coffee and I was sure she wanted to listen in but Dev remained quiet while she poured coffee and placed the cream and sugar on the table for Dev.  I got to watch his hands as he stirred his cup of coffee and pour the sugar in.  He wasn't delicate.  Sage wasn't either, but Dev was not the same type of man as Sage either.  Dev whispered, "You can't keep comparing us."

I looked up at his eyes and smiled.  "I'm not comparing you to find who's better.  I'm just seeing the differences.  I like the differences.  Means I'm not gettin carbon copies."

Dev grinned at me.  "To answer your question.  Let me and Dee spend the night tonight.  I can help you and we can see if we are sleep compatiable.  The boys are home so Dee will be disappointed but one thing we've learned is that if you can't spend the night with the other person then chances of it making through more than a few months is going to be low."

I grinned, "At least one of us has enough relationships to guide us."

"You and Sage struggling?"

I shook my head.  "No.  He's my first romantic relationship.  I've had girls who I've slept with more than once but it was just sex.  I don't do relationships as a standard, or I didn't until I met Sage and that all changed."

"So you never wanted to settle down?"  Dev asked just before Bonnei brought out our steak and vegetables.  Dev looked up at Bonnie, "This is his usual?  It's not even on the menu."

Bonnie smiled.  "There was a boy, once long ago who loved my daddy's steaks.  My husband said whe he took the place over said, it's too expensive.  We need to do something different.  We still sell steak off the menu.  if you know to ask for it.  All because even my husband hated watching that little boy have a panic attack."

"What's a little boy doing eating steak in a diner?  Why didn't his parents just make him some if he had to have it.  Sounds like a spoiled little kid."  Dev said.

Bonnie looked at me and I smiled, "I'll handle that conversation.  Thanks Bonnie."

"I was that little boy."  I said to Dev as I cut into my steak.  "I didn't have parents.  It was what Dorian ordered me the first time I came here.  It was comforting and that's why it became the norm."


"Nox.  I'm sorry. I didn't know."  Dev said reaching across the table.

"It's alright.  I probably was a spoiled child.  I have nothing.  I had even less then.  I usually got what I wanted, but I didn't want much. Still don't."

We ate in relative silence.  It wasn't the date either of us had wanted.  So much for first impressions.

When we were almost finish Dev tapped his fork on the plate making an annoying ting ting ting.  I looked up at him from across the table and he was deep in thought.  I sighed.  "I'm sorry."

Dev laughed, "For what.  I'm not one who spouted insults without knowing the story."

"I'm sorry lunch didn't turn out liked we'd hoped."

"But it did," Dev shrugged.  "We got to know each other a little better."

"We've hardly spoken."

"True.  But I learned you didn't have any parents.  I know Dorian brought you here as a kid.  You find steak comforting."

I sighed.  "Okay, any of that I could have told you any other time too.  You know me better than I know you."

"So what do you want to know?"  Dev asked with a bright smile on his face.  His eyes sparkled with delight.  I couldn't help but smile back.

"I don't know."  I said looking back down at my plate.  I wasn't good at this.  I didn't want to know people before.  I didn't know what to say or what to do.  I finished my plate in silence.

Dev dropped some cash on the table and took my hand and dragged me across the bench.  "Come on.  You brood too much."  He glanced at the time on the wall and then pulled me out into the street.  "Show me your place."

# I Hate This Elevator

We walked into the AU building holding hands.  Dev headed for the elevator and my heart started to race as it always did.  We didn't even make it past Atlas before Dev stopped and looked at me with concern.  "Not only did you just shut off before that you were afraid."  He whispered.  "What's wrong?"

I shook my head.  "Nothing.  Afraid of heights."

Dev chuckled.  "You live in a skyscrapper."

"I take the stairs."

"How far up?"

"I wouldn't suggest you walking them if you need to get to work soon."  I said and started walking towards the elevator with Dev following behind still holding my hand.

We waited for the elevator with the rest of the people.  Dev's hand slipped around my waist as we stood in the small crowd that always formed at the base of the glass death traps.  Dev started humming in my ear as he pressed the front of his body against my side.

The doors swooshed open and people piled out and then we all got on.  The doors closed and the only thing I could smell was the countless smokers in the small enclosed space. The smell pulled and tore at memories inside my head and I closed my eyes.  Dev pulled me closer to him and I buried my face against his neck and breathed in only his soft clean citrus scent and he whispered in my ear.  "Now take it in but don't look down /
'Cause I'm on top of the world, 'ey / I'm on top of the world, 'ey / Waiting on this for a while now / Paying my dues to the dirt / I've been waiting to smile, 'ey."

I focused on his voice in my ear and his scent.  The calm enveloped me.  And I started to wonder about a lot of things in my life.  We still have too many floor to go before we had to get off.  I didn't want to think about why were two guys so easy to manipulate my emotions and my body.  Dev continued his soft song, "Been holding it in for a while, 'ey / Take it with me if I can / Been dreaming of this since a child /I'm on top of the world," while my thoughts ranged through the why's and how's of Sage and Dev.  And Dee.  This wasn't going to be just the three of us there was a fourth and I didn't even know her.  But I had reacted to her too.  Fuck.  What was going on?

We reached our floor and the elevator was almost empty when we got off, there was someone waiting for us to exit when we got there.  I didn't know the red head's name as we passed, she lived on the floor somewhere but she was a few years older than I was and I was horrible with names, but she recognized me, and frowned when she didn't recognize Dev but she didn't say anything.

Dev laughed as I was pulling my keys out of my pocket.  "She thinks you are cheating too."

"To normal people I would be.  They won't get it."  I said.  "They barely understand me and Sage, much less I am seeing two others on top of him."

"You okay now?"  He asked.

"I am.  Thank you." I pushed the door open, "Welcome to my humble abode."



# My Studio

Dev walked in and looked around.  "This is all you have?"

"I told you I don't have much."  I went around the counter and bar into the kitchen.  "Coffee or water?  it's all I have here."

Dev laughed, "Coffee is fine."  He walked around the apartment.  He opened the closet and scoffed.   He closed it and went through the drawers.  "Sage says you haven't moved in, yet there is nothing here."

I shrugged.  "He doesn't want the place to exist.  He thinks because I still have it I don't think of his house as home.  But I do think of his place as home.  I only spend nights here when I have to be here early."

"Do you have nightmares here?"  Dev asked as he sat down on my bed and flopped backwards to stare at the ceiling.

"I have nightmares anytime I'm away from Sage." I pour two cups of coffee from the pot I'd been brewing while Dev wandered.  "Except when you spent the night, I didn't have nightmares then either."

"Why do you think that is?"  Dev asked as I sat down next to him and handed him a cup with cream and sugar.

"Sage make's me feel safe." My voice dropped into a whisper as I continued, "You make me feel safe.  And it scares me."

"Why does it scare you?"  Dev asked plucking my coffee from my hands.

"You just don't scare me.  Sage too." I confided.  Dev moved me backwards and straddled my legs.  It was uncomfortable sitting like that so I laid down.  Dev grinned at me and laid down on top of me.  His body weight pressing my into the mattress.

"So what about us scares you?"  Dev said above me, his lips a hairs breath above mine, his voice was filled with lust and desire and I could feel him through my clothes.

I grined up at him.  "It's hard to think with you like this."

Dev pressed harder into my body, letting his weight press me deeper into the mattress.  "So don't think.  Jutst talk to me."

I gasped for air and my eyes closed as I felt him against me.  My voice was a bare whisper.  "I'm afraid of losing myself in you.  Giving you everything without realizing it."

"And Sage?"  Dev breathed out across my skin and it sent shivers up my spine.  I gave a small moan and Dev reacted by pressing his hips harder against mine.

"It was a collective you."  I whispered.

Dev laughed against my neck as he kissed it.  His voice was rough with lust.  "I want to mark you.   But you aren't mine yet to mark."

"I am."

Dev rolled off of me and sighed as he stared up at the ceiling. "No Nox, not yet.  I don't think Sage is ready yet to share you alone with either of us.  We will honor his desire."

I nodded.  My body was cold and I ached for him, but he was right.  We didn't belong to each other.  We weren't a couple.  Hell we weren't anything.  Dating was only to get to know each other so it wasn't like fucking a stranger.  Sage didn't want that, no one night stands.  But Dev made me want more and Sage was pushing us together.  I knew this would end badly.

Dev rolled over and pressed a finger to my lips.  "Shhhh, Pretty boy.  This won't end badly."  He grabbed my chin with a gentle touch and turned me towards him.  "Sage is afraid of losing you.  You are afraid of losing him.  Slowly, Nox.  You fall to fast.  I barely touch you and I have you so easily in my grip.  You listen far easier to Dee than you want.  You say you don't want anything from us.  But your body does, your mind does.  Let's learn that before you condemn us all to a misery and desruction."  He pressed a soft kiss to my lips.  "I should go.  I think you need a cold showere."

I sighed.  "I don't mind waiting until I see Sage, lover."

Dev grinned and pressed anther kiss to my lips.  "I'll see you Friday when I pick up Sage?"

I nodded.  "I need to call Dee still."

Dev laughed.  "She says she'll be there with bells on."

"What's with you two and bells?"

Dev grinned as he kissed me long and hard.  He pulled away breathless and stood up.  I watched him walk to my front door and put his hand on the knob.  He smirked, "You are gorgeous like that.  I should make you stay that way all day.  Let Sage find you like this."

I groaned.  "Please don't.  I have work to do."

Dev laughed.  "Not today, but one day I will."  His smirk made his eyes sparkle.  "Tonight then, pretty boy."  And with that he left me alone on my bed wishing he hadn't been so honoroable.



# Fouresome

The rest of the day was rather bland compared to morning.  Paperwork and boring things.  Though I called Dee and asked her out on Friday night.  I had run through the conversation so many times before I called her that when she answered and said she'd love to hang out with me on Friday I was a bit surprised and dumbfounded.  She'd said she was waiting for my call since Dev told her.  We didn't talk long, though she said we'd see each other later.  Dev had plans she said.  The way she said it made it sound like what it wasn't.  Dev was planning something dangerous not something sexy.  He wanted support.  I wasn't sure I wanted him to put himself at risk but as much as I hated to say it, he was a hero in his own right too.  Had to save someone if he could.  I didn't blame him, I was the same way.  I hated it about myself sometimes.  It was more trouble than it was worth.

But Sage and I planned dinner.  He was nervous.  He flittered about the kitchen while we waited.  The boys had pizza again and were downstairs hanging out.  It was just Fae and Drake, Matt couldn't get away on the weekdays.  We were lucky to have him on the weekends.  I trusted Fae with Drake, but Fae was more inclined to come upstairs when he knew he shouldn't.  He was a social creature.  And wolves disliked being a lone.  I think Fae needed a real pack, not mine little make shift one of people I was gathering around me. But he seemed content except when he had only Drake.

The doorbell rang and Sage jumped.  "I'll never get used to that," he said as he headed down the hall towards the front door.

I followed him to greet our guests.  Sage opened the door and presed himself up against the open door while Dee pulled in a large suitcase and Dev had a small backpack with his things.  I laughed, "Dee you planning on staying a while?"

She laughed but didn't say anything as she headed up towards the bedroom.  "I'll just put these in your room Sage?"

He nodded.  "Yeah.  You know the way."

I frowned but quickly hid the disappointment  behind the fake smile I wore in public.  Sage had slept with her in our bed - alone.  And I looked at Dev, he was watching his girlfriend go up the stairs.  I sighed and turned back towards the kitchen.  "Dinner will be ready soon."

I heard Sage and Dev exchange words and then the door closed.  Dev followed me into the kitchen.  Sage made a noisy exit up the stairs.  When Dev came into the kitchen he was empty handed, Sage must have taken his things up stairs.

Dev asked, "You alright?"

I shrugged.  "I'm fine," I snapped.

Dev sat down at the island, "That doesn't sound fine."

"You know they are fucking right?  Have been for a while."  I said.

"Of course they are."

"Are you sleeping with him too?"  I asked.  I know I sounded like a jealous boyfriend.  And I was.  My boyfriend was fucking someone else in our bed.  I was very much aware of how much of a hypocrit I sounded at the moment.  We had an open relationship.  My idea to keep Sage happy.  So he could explore and do and not leave me.  And now ... I sighed.

Dev looked at me, he hadn't answered my question.  "I've only had sex with Sage with Dee."

"So you and I can't, but they can.  Lovely."  I pulled out four plates from the cupboard and slammed the door closed in fustration.

I set the plates on the island and looked at Dev.  I shook my head.  "I need to go for a run."  I walked out of the kitchen and towards the stairs, but Dev caught my arm and stopped me.

"If you go up there right now you won't be happy."   Dev tried to pull me close to him but I stood my ground.

"I'm perfectly aware they are having sex right now.  I can hear them."  I yanked out of his grip and went upstairs anyway.  I opened the door and didn't look at the bed.  I didn't look at Sage's half naked body with Dee sitting on top of him.  Her hands rubbing his chest her, her skirt hitched up and his fingers pressing into her hips.  I didn't look.  I swear to fucking god I didn't want to look but I saw everything.  Smelt the familiar scent of sex in the air.  They looked at me as I rounded the corner and went into the closet to change into running clothes.

I came back out and they were still in the same position though they had stopped to watch me.  I didn't say anything as I headed down stairs in shorts and a t-shirt.  I grabbed my phone and keys and headed for the door.  Dev took my arm again - gentler this time.  He was frowning at me.  "Don't go like this."

"If I don't go like this I'll blow the fuck up Dev.  It's alright for them to fuck under our noses but we can't because Sage isn't ready to share me alone.  I beleive you when you say he's not ready.  If it's because you don't want to that's perfectly fine too, but I can't be here.  I thought he wanted to watch.  Seems he's more interested in women than me."

And I left without another word.

# Long Run

I broke my rules.  I went for a run and I didn't follow the same path I always did.  I ran from Sage's apartment back to the AU building.  I ran the 55 flights of stairs twice before I went to the Night Life building.  I could have called Ant.  It was dusk now he should be awake.  But I didn't.  I didn't even grab a cup of coffee.  I ran to the edge of Dom's territory and thought about crossing over just to get into a fight.  I needed to blow off more steam and I really couldn't do that anyplace in public.

Instead I ran through Central Park.  I don't know how many miles I ran.  I could look, my phone would tell me.  I don't know how mny times my playlist ran through.  Sage had called me three times and I didn't answer.  Dev and Dee had both tried.  My phone was blinking rapidly for all the missed texts I had.  I don't know how long I was gone for, I didn't really fucking care at this point.

By the time I was back in Hell's Kitchen it was late.  The street lamps were sheding their putrid yellow light and I sat down on Sage's front stoop to catch my breath.  I sat there until my breath was normal and then some.  I heard the door open behind me and Sage came out.  I could smell the jasmine and lavender in the air before he sat down next to me pressing his leg against mine.  "What's wrong, Nox?"

I shook my head.  "Nothing's wrong Sage."

"Yes there is.  You took off without eating.  I thought we had plans tonight.  To your shields or something."  He said confused.

"I'm here, they are here.  Nothing's changed."  I said.

"Why did you go for a run?"  He pleaded with me.

"Because I was jealous.  Alright.  You've been fucking them both without me.  You were fucking Dee right under my nose."

"You said..."

"I know what I said."  I interrupted.  "I'm perfectly aware I'm being a hypocrit right now.  I said you could.  I shouldn't be jealous, yet I am.  What makes it worse Sage is that I had the chance to do the same thing today.  To sleep with Dev.  And I wanted to.  I would have if he hadn't stopped us."

"Why didn't you?"  He asked as he shifted away from me leaving a small gab between us.

"Dev said you weren't ready to share me when you weren't around."  I sighed, "But I think he said that because I had thought it."

I stood up.  "I'm tired.  I need a shower." I left Sage sitting on the front stoop and headed towards the bedroom to grab a shower.



# All of Us Together

I took a shower - a long hot shower alone.  The problem was I didn't want to be alone.  I wanted something but I didn't know what it was.  I felt it, but I couldn't explain it.  I needed it like I needed air.  But the more I thought about Sage with another person I found myself drowning in the unexplainable.  It hurt to be jealous.

I could hear the three of them out in the bedroom.  I couldn't make out what they said without straining.  Even after turning the water off I couldn't hear them talking.  I could hear Dee laugh, and Dev's deep voice.  I knew Sage was there, I could almost hear the softness in his voice when there was quiet between the other two. My soft spoken boy enjoying his friends.  But I couldn't hide any longer I was tired.  My body ached in so many ways that I just wanted to lie down, curl up and die.  I could feel the anxiety pressing in on me.  Tonight was not going to be a good night.

When I opened the door Sage stood up and walked to me.  "You feel better?"

But I didn't answer Dev did, "No Sage, he's worse.  Bring him here."

Dee's lips were pointed down in a frown burrowing lines in her forehead.  "He's had too much time to think."

Sage laughed.  "That's all he does is think."  He took me by he hand and pulled me towards his side of the bed.  It was a King sized bed, there was more than enough room for the four of us if we didn't mind touching.   Dev was holding the blankets up in the middled, Dee was on the other side of him.  They intended to put me between Dev and Sage.

Dev smiled.  "I need Dee's help, and you need Sage's to ground you.  Trust me."

I laid down next to him and nodded.  "I trust you because Sage trusts you."

"You trust him that much?" Dee asked her voice silk over my skin.  Dev chuckled as he laid down beside me.

"I trust him that much." I said.  I trusted Sage with my life.

We all got comfortable in bed.  There wasn't a lot of shifting before I could hear the soft sound of Sage's breath in my ear as he slept.  His head was on my shoulder, where I usually laid on his.  It felt oddly comforting to have him there.  His hand drapped across my stomach.  Dev was laying on his side, he hadn't fallen asleep yet.  I could feel his breath against my neck, his hand on my chest.  Dee was behind him wrapped around him, her arm over his hip and her fingers touching my stomach.  Sage and Dee's fingers were touching as they both slumbered around us.

Dev whispered.  "You need to sleep so we can do this."

"I'm trying."

"What's wrong?"  He asked.

"If I close my eyes..."

"You'll dream?" Dev asked.

"Yes and no.  I'm always afraid to go to sleep."

Dev started humming again and sang softly in my ear. "I know you, I walked with you once upon a dream / I know you, that look in your eyes is so familiar a gleam / And I know it's true that visions are seldom all they seem / But if I know you, I know what you'll do / You'll love me at once, the way you did once upon a dream."

I drifted into the darkness listening to Dev's soft whisper in my ear.

# Broken Shields

The darkness shifted and stirred.  The fog rolled in but the sun came out and burnt the darkness and fog away.  I was standing in a empty space - void of all things.  It was more like floating except I felt the ground underneath my feet.  Around me was nothing and everything.  I felt the heat and the cold on my legs.  I could feel the breeze on my skin and the earth beneath my feet but I saw nothing.

The light flickered, the world brightened a moment and then I saw things I should be able to see.  Standing in front of me was Dev as beautiful as he was.  He didn't have the beauty of a girl, with long flowing locks and perfect curves.  No, he was beautiful in other ways.  The color of his baby blue eyes were brighter here.  His skin gave a soft glow that was otherworldly.  He smiled at me and I felt like I would melt.  "Look around you."

His voice wasn't quite real.  It echoed in the nothingness of the space.  Just a bunch of bubbles.

Dev grinned at me and as he reached out a pink bubble floated towards him, or we floated to it.  I saw a bunch of lines and wires connecting the bubbles.  This pink one was thick and opaque, you couldn't see inside.  "This is Dee.  Her dreams, her shield, her light.  I found her like this.  No matter how hard I tried I couldn't get inside, I couldn't see past the wall.  So I found her.  We have been together ever since.  I still can't get in.  But I know her better for it.  I can't read her like I read you.  Hell, I can't read anyone like I read you."  Dev sounded exasperated at me.

I frowned.  "I'm sorry."

He smiled and pulled me close, "It's not your fault.  I like it, it's just odd."

Dev reached for another bubble, it was covered with electric blue, it sparked when Dev's hand touched it.  It looked like it could hurt, but it didn't.  "This is Sage.  His power protects him.  And it tries to expand to others close by."  He brought it close to Dees and the electricity curled around it like a creepy electronic ooze."  He smiled at me.  "That's what happens every night with you.  Sage's shield protects you."

Dev pulled two more orbs towards us and he frowned, "This is yours."  The one in his hand looked so much different than the others.  I could see the black veins in it, like frozen water in a sidewalk, pushing at it until it crumbles.  "Sage is keeping covering the holes that let it in through the black veins.  I don't know what it is.  I'm not sure I want to find out."   Dev said as he held it out to me.  "Take it."

He held his own clear orb.  It shimmered in the light - perfect, untouched, clear and but I could tell it was more than a thin bubble for every insecurity I had, Dev had his own and I could see them in the thickness of the wall he had.  I gave him a shy smile as I took my representation from him.  It was heavier than it looked.  And the sheild was rough with abuse.  It reminded me of my back - scared and broken.

Dev put his hand on the small of my back and I felt electricity course through my body.  "Sage will protect you, Dee will give me strength.  Let me help you rebuild your shield.  We need to break this one first.  It'll hurt."  Dev held me close as he whispered the next part.  "If we are quick enough we can build the wall before the veins attack again."

I nodded.  I didn't know what to say.  "We need to sit down then."

Dev complied and pulled me into his arms as I joined him on the invisible ground.  It was surreal floating in nothingness and yet I wasn't afraid.  I felt the earth below me even though it wasn't there.  There was a fleeting moment of panic before Dev wrapped his arm around my waist.  "We have to be quick.  Crush it and build the wall.  Sage will protect us.  Dee with give us the strength."

I took a deep breath and pressed my hands together around the broken orb.  I could feel the brittle piece of nothing crumble between my fingers as I closed my hands together.  The sheild drifted into the breeze and I felt Dev push me mentally, pulling my walls around me.  I closed my eyes, found that place that centered me and built the walls.  I felt Dee giving us strength.  I felt the static charge of Sage all around me.  Dev's arms tight around my body as we built the wall.  There was a high pitched echo in the emptiness of our space.

The darkness started to creep into our emptiness like a fog in the day.  It rolled towards us and when the last edges of the bubble sealed it screamed and then winked out, leaving us in the warm yet cool sunlight of this dream plane.

And then a short shrill scream followed by a growl periced my sleep.

# Nightmare

My eyes shot open and I was sitting upright.  There was no doubt in my mind that it was Drake who had screamed downstairs so far from us.  I was out of bed and hadn't cared if I tore the blankets from my lovers.  I was down the stairs in almost one giant leap.  Around the banister and knocked over the glass bowl I used to keep my keys in as I rushed towards the basement door.  I pulled it so hard it smacked against the wall and left a hole in the dry wall but I hardly notices as I rushed down the stairs careful not to smack my head against the low hanging ceiling.

Down the hall into the spare bedroom I found my boys with a thing - a creature of blackness. It dripped and oozed like the veins of my shield had.  It's eyes were red and I froze.  They glowed in it's head like my dream come to life.

It laughed at me, it's jagged teeth dripping red.  A fine line of blood shown on Drake's neck and I wove a tight pattern of air and flung it at the creature.  It hissed as the air made it fly towards the far wall dropping Drake on the bed as it was plastered to the wall unable to move.

Fae's eyes were golden and his teeth were bared.  His hands were elongated and his hair shaggier than usual.  He was shifting from adrelaline and I had a scared Dragon crying.  It was all danger, so much danger but I loved these boys and the black creature had hurt them.  I used all the elements and I crushed the creature much like I had the orb on the dream plane.  It didn't shatter or crumble.  It squished and oozed and screamed a horrible scream as I sucked the air from its lungs, buried it alive in an orb of air while buring and drowning it all from the inside out.  I didn't wish that death on anyone - but this thing had hurt my boys.

The screaming had stopped but my fury did not. It continued until there was a hand on my shoulder.  I blinked to see Faelen was his self.  Drake was healed and happily sleeping in Dee's arms.  Sage was sitting with Fae petting his head in his lap.  Dev's hand was on my shoulder.  "You can stop now."

I looked at the orb in front of me and I dropped it in the waste bin.  It was nothing but goo, there was nothing solid left of the creature.  And then I collapsed to the floor.

# Next Morning

I woke alone in bed.  There was no warmth other than the comforter piled on top of me.  I shifted to my back and I heard movemnt to my left.  I turned my head and saw Dorian sitting there.  "You scared everyone, my boy."

"Is everyone okay?"  I asked.

Dorian nodded.  "Drake is fine.  Deborah says the cut healed quickly while she was standing there watching what happened.  Faelen is having a panic attack because he changed.  Sage is working.  Devin is making coffee for the two of us.  He called in sick, refused to go to work while you lay unconscious."

"How long have I been out?"

"It's 2pm now.  Sage called me and told me you dropped after killing a creature."  Dorian moved over to me and placed his hand on my head.  "No one saw what it was but you, Nox.  Can you tell me what you saw?"

"It was a creature.  Give me m notebook."  I sat up and nodded towards the drawer he was sitting next to.

Dorian handed me the spiral sketchbook with the pencil embedded in the spine.  "It's not under your pillow."  He commented I took it from his graceful hands.

"Sage says it gives me nightmares."

Dev came in bearing two cups of coffee.  He smiled when he saw me and handed Dorian a cup.  "I'll go make another."

I shook my head.  "I'm alright."

Dorian offered me his.  "I'll go make my own.  You can have this one."  I took the black coffee from Dorian and smiled.  "I'll be back in a little while."

I sipped the coffee and set it on the nightstand and started drawing.  Dev sat next to me on the bed sipping his own coffee.  His inky black hair was disheveld and I just wanted to run my hands through it and make it even more so.  He snickered at me and placed a kiss on my neck.  "I'm going to go tell Sage you are awake, and call Dee tell her the good news."

I nodded.  I was left alone in the dim light of Sage's bedroom - our bedroom.  And drew what I remembered of the monster that had attacked Drake and Faelen.  I remembered the red glowing eyes.  I manipulated the make up of the pencil and the color turned red as I colored in the eyes.  They were flat against the paper but they felt like they were boring into my soul.  It was the same eyes I saw every night.  The same that had made me bloody only yesterday.

That thing and Garrett were connected.  I don't know how, and I don't know why, but they were connected.

Sage walked into the room and flipped on the light and snuck into his room where he kept the video feeds.  My watcher boyfriend had been watching me sleep.  He smiled at me as he whispered, "I wasn't recording."

He wrapped his arms around me and I nodded.  "I know.  You didn't want to leave but you had to I get it.  Did you tell Dev?"

He nodded against my neck.  "I told him how to turn it on, I couldn't stand not being up here with you."  He pressed a light kiss to my temple.  "Is that what hurt the boys?"

I nodded.  "Yeah.  And I think Garrett sent it to me.  I think it's a nightmare. I'll have to speak with Ant about it, he's the only one I know who knows about the old monsters of our legends."

Dev laughed, "You mean there are things you don't know about?"

I looked up and smiled at him.  "Dee said hi, I'm glad you are awake.  And she told me to hit you hard in the arm.  But I'm not going to."  He sat down on the edge of the bed and pressed a kiss to my cheek.

"The Venatori don't hunt legendary monsters.  At least not most of us.  There are specialized Venatori who do.  They aren't like us.  They are savage and viscious and they kill whatever stands in their way, human, monster, supernatural.  We call them Metus.  Latin for fear and dread.  Those that become metus are worse than the people I grew up with.  They are like the serial killers of all things.  If we find a metus in our territory we usually send an army of hunters to kill it.  Metus don't care what damage they do."  I knew I was scaring them.  I meant to.  Metus were real.  I knew old creatures existed.  This was old had to be.

Dev pulled me close and hugged me.  Sage wrapped his arms around both of us and spoke softly, "If it scares you that much I don't think I want to know more, Nox.  You'll keep us safe."

I sighed.  "I'll do what I can Sage."  I felt safe in their arms but I had to go talk to Garrett.  "I need to talk to Garrett."

Sage shook his head. "No.  I don't want you going near him."

Dev agreed.  "I don't think I do either, if he sends things with glowing eyes after you."

"I have to know why."

Sage sighed.  "Be careful Nox.  I have to get back to work.  I'm glad you are okay.  I love you."  The last he whispered in my ear then pressed a kiss to my mouth.

Dev and I watched Sage leave the room.  He was tapping away at his phone before he even left the room.  I asked, "Did what we do work?"

Dev smiled.  "Yeah.  I think that's why it came after us.  Or after the weakest link."  Dev touched my temple with both hands and he projected an image into my head.  My breath caught but he pressed his lips to mine and I relaxed into the image.  He was showing me my shield.  He whispered against my lips, "It's beautiful.  Shimmering with reds, golds, blues, and greens."  He let go of my head and I let go of the breath I'd been holding.  "I've never seen anything like it Nox.  Not a black vein in sight.  I'll check it every night for a while.  I'd almost like you to spend the night away from us."

I shook my head.  "Not anytime soon."

Dev nodded in agreement.  "I agree.  Right now you need to protect your family and I get that.  And I don't think Sage is going to let you out of his sight for that long.  Call me later?"

I smiled.  "I can do that.  You going?"

"Yeah.  I have to get to work too.  Dee said she'd call later check on the boys after school."  He pressed another kiss to my lips and I let out a soft moan.  He laughed.  "You are so easy pretty boy."

I grinned at him.  "Only for you."

"Is that another collective you?"  Dev grinned.

"Yeah I think so. I..."  Dev pressed his finger to my lips and interrupted my words.

"Not yet pretty boy.  Not yet.  But I know."  He kissed my forehead and walked away.  "Call me pretty boy."

I listened to him walk down the stairs and close the basement door behind him.  He was saying goodbye to Sage.  And when I thought I might be jealous I found out I really wasn't.  Maybe there was room for all of them.



# My Son

I took a shower.  I got dressed and went down stairs.  It all seemed so surreal after what had happened.  I felt numb but I needed to see the boys.  All three of them.  I found Dorian sitting on the couch flipping channels on Sage's television.  "What you stil doing here?"

He smiled at me, "I figured you could use someone to talk to since you aren't seeing Margo anymore."  Dorian turned the idiot box off and turned towards me and patted the chair next to him.  "Talk to me Nox."

"I don't even know where to start, Dorian."  I said as I sat down next to him.  I leaned against him like I had many times over the years and he wrapped his arm around my shoulder.  "I don't know what to make of all this."

"All of what?"  he asked to coax more words to flow.

"Sage.  And Dev.  And Dee.  Me, us.  Any of it.  The boys.  Garrett.  Margo.  Hell my father.  I just don't know Dorian."

He pressed his lips to my temple.  "Start where it makes sense."

"Nothing makes sense.  I want my boys.  I want to hold them right now.  Keep them safe.  I failed last night."

Dorian chuckled.  "I don't think you failed.  You can't keep them from danger no matter how hard you try."

"But it's my fault." My eyes burned with unshed tears.

"It maybe, but that thing is responsible for hurting the boys.  You didn't tell it to.  From what Devin says you were working on saving yourself.  Which I think was a necessary step, don't you?"

"Not if it means my boys get hurt."

Dorian laughed.  "You've been a father for a few months and the children aren't even your blood and you would do anything for them.  You are a much better man than I am."

I shook my head.  "No I'm not."

"I wasn't much younger than you when you came into my life, Nox.  You were a scared little boy and I never loved you.  Not the way you do Drake.  Not when you needed it most."  Dorian's voice was filled with regret and sorry.  It made my heart ache.

"You were what I needed, when I needed it, Dorian."

"No my boy, I wasn't.  You needed to be loved after your mother threw you away.  I didn't."

I shrugged.  "But you cared for me.  You were what I needed to get through.  Always a strong shoulder to cry on.  I might have needed love, Dorian.  But you were what I needed when I needed it.  I don't care that you didn't love me then.  I'm okay with who I am because of you."

Dorian shook his head.  "Always amaze me.  I do love you, as much as my own son."

I grinned up at him and placed a kiss on his cheek.  "I know.  Let me say good-bye to Sage and you can walk me back to the AU building."



# I Love You

I left Dorian sitting on the couch flipping through stations again.  Sage was sitting at his computer in his basement office busily typing away at his computer.  I stood behind him and watched for a little while.  I placed my hands on his shoulders and pressed my thumbs into his tense muscles.  "You work too hard."

He groaned before he anwsered me lolling his head back between my hands and looking up at me.  "I'm stressed over you."

I sighed.  "I'm sorry, love."

He turned around and pulled me into his down into his lap.  "It's alright, Nox.  You killed that thing with your power.  I knew what happened, but when you had done it before it was nothing like this."

I dropped my eyes.  "I got carried away.  When I was aware of what I'd done my body retaliated.  It was on fire.  And then there was you and Dev and Dee around me and I was okay again."

"You like him don't you?"  Sage asked me.  He didn't make me meet his eyes, but I looked up to see him frowning and looking down as well.

"I like him a lot."

"You'll leave me for him."  He said quietly.

"I'm not going anywhere, Sage."  I didn't know how to tell him.

"I'm not what you need, he is.  I see it."  Sage looked up.  "I'm okay with that.  That you love him.  I know you love me."

"I do love you.  I haredly know Dev.  But you are right, I do have feelings for him, maybe not love yet, but it's possible."

Sage gave me a wry grin, "Back when you were talking to Margo, we talked too.  Told her that I didn't think I could be what you needed me to be.  I can't be the man you need.  But I can't see see a life without your smile or your cooking in my life."  He grinned playfully at me.  "I don't need to be everything.  Dev and Dee can fill in the gaps.  I grew up knowing that my life was different from others.  I grew up thinking I was never going to be enough.  Turns out I don't need to be.  I just need to be me right?"

I nodded.  "I love you Nox.  And if I made you upset with Dee and Dev I'm sorry."

"I wasn't angry.  I was angry that I was jealous.  That you were sleeping with her and Dev and I were being good.  I need you to say it Sage.  Like so many other things I need need to hear the words."

Sage pulled me down for a kiss.  His tongue slipped into my mouth and we both hummed against each other.  When we parted Sage pressed my forehead against his.  "Nox, you can sleep with Dev and/or Dee without me present."  He pulled back and smiled.  "I know we said it was for watching you, but with them, I know you won't leave us.  You won't take Drake and Fae from me, you won't keep Matt from coming here.  I know that with them, we'll be happy.  Maybe one day we can all live together, all seven of us."

I laughed, "That sounds like a really big apartment we'd have to have."

Sage nodded. "One day.  Some day."  He kissed me.  "I have to get back to work.  You going to the AU building?"

I nodded.  "I am.  I'll bring all the boys back with me.  We might be doing a family sleep over for a few nights."

Sage grinned.  "That's fine with me.  I like puppy piles."

"Me too."  I kissed him.  "Me too."

# Train Ride

When I got upstairs Dorian was waiting for me by the door.  The glass bowl I used was missing and I wondered who cleaned it up.  "Did I scare them a lot?"  I asked Dorian as we walked out of the front door into the late summer air.

"You scared me a lot.  I'm sure that you scared those you love more."

"You aren't going to comment on the number of people I love?"  I asked with a wry smile.  I didn't really expect an answer.  Dorian was very much about image and I did not fit his image.

He smirked.  "Nox, you have never been a normal boy.  Why should your love life be simple?  There is a lot of things that your heart needs to make up for.  I never thought I'd see the day where you committed to anything other than your children."

The train station around the corner was busy, there were people waiting which meant the train was late.  Tempers would fly but for once I was hardly in a rush.  Dorian was still smirking at me.  "I see the change in you."

I smiled.  "What change?"

"A burden lifted.  The patterns around you they are flowing without faultering.  I know you can't see yourself and I don't half your talent for drawing as you do, but the change is so fundamental to your general being that I'm surprised no ever saw it before."  He shook his head.

"No one sees things like I do."  I said.  "I know you say you can see parts of it.  Dev showed me what my shield looks like now.  I feel better."

The train rattled to a stop and we waited until everyone piled off so we could enter a full car.  We held on to the rail above our heads as it clacked down the track making stops.  We didn't talk, but Dorian's eyes never really strayed from me.

We got off the train at our stop and when we reached the surface I asked Dorian, "Is it that different?"

He nodded.  "Yes, Nox.  I'm trying to find the differences so I can explain it to you, but it's like I know it's different but I can't really see what was wrong before.  But something was wrong."

The AU building was in sight, the towering buildings all around us.  It was a beautiful sight amist the square buildings.  It's form unique.  It was why the Eriksen's built it that way - to stand out - to hide in plain sight.

Once inside the AU building I looked up and followed the glass elevator up and frowned.  Some fears weren't so easily conquered.  But we climbed into the next available car up and I took a breath and hummed a tune that Dev had sang to me the night before.  When we hit HQ Dorian took my elbow and walked me out.  He was chuckling to himself.  "I have never seen you so calm on an elevator before.  Is this new?"

I smiled.  "Yeah.  Dev was with me last time.  He sang to me.  He does that when I get anxious.  I think it's starting to stick."

"First Sage, now Devin.  I hope she's as good for you as both of them."

I smiled.  "I'm sure she will be.  I'm going to take the stairs to find Garrett."

Dorian shook his head and pointed towards Dae'lin's office.  "I told Dae'lin to give him a ring and you can talk to him there."

"Thanks."  I pressed a kiss to Dorian's cheek.  "For everything, Dorian.  I don't thank you enough."

"You are my boy.  Always will be Nox.  Even Kai can't take that away from us."

I smiled at him and waved as he walked away.  He wasn't blood, but he was truly the only father I ever needed.



# Confronting My Demon

Garrett was talking with Dae'lin in her office.  I knocked and I paled when I saw the look on Garrett's face.  He waved for me to enter not that I had been waiting for his invitation.  Dae'lin's back was to me when I entered and when the door closed the windows went black.  Not the shades being pulled down, they turned black.  Dae'lin turned around and I saw dead dark eyes and I took a step backwards.  The door knob was stabbing into my backside and I couldn't breathe.  It wasn't magic, but fear.  Nothing but fear...

"So good of you to join us."  A voice said from Dae'lin's mouth, but it wasn't hers.  She reached for me and I cringed away from her but there was no where for me to go as her cold fingers traced along the tattoo and down my jawline.  "Fear never tasted so good from anyone else."

There was a flash of light and then several tentacles of air and fire were behind Dae'lin and I stared at them.  Dae'lin couldn't do that.  Dae'lin couldn't touch more than one element at a time, but this demon had possession of her, he could.  His fingers dug into my chin as he grabbed it and made me look at Dae'lin's dead eyes.  "What did you do?"

I felt a crushing pain around me as the demon beat at my shield on a plane I couldn't see.  It was like my heart was being crushed in my chest.  I couldn't breathe.  Darkness swept over me as I lost consciousness.

It had to be only two or three seconds as I gasped for breath and the demon was standing over me.  "It's stronger than before.  What did you do?"

Dae'lin's small hand flew across my cheek and I felt my teeth rattle in my head.  I could taste the blood blooming in my mouth.  The demon growled, "Oh the strength.  I could break you couldn't I boy."

Garrett put his hands on Dae'lin's shoulders and spoke, "Let me be your vessel.  I want nothing more than to do your bidding Morpheus.  Let me have him back."

Dae'lin looked up at him and he laughed.  "If I inhabit you, he will not stop and think about killing you.  This one, he loves.  He'll not hurt her."

I reached up in one quick motion and grabbed Dae'lin's throat and squeezed.  I didn't just use my hand.  I wrapped air around her neck and I put a bubble of air and sucked out the air from inside.

Dae'lin's hand flailed and she grabbed hold of Garrett and I watched as the demon passed through Dae'lin into Garrett.  Dae'lin fell into my arms and the demon in Garrett's body opened the door and started to run.  I dropped my patterns around Dae'lin and wrapped her in the elements quickly before I took off after Garrett.  He ran for the stairs and like an idiot he ran upstairs.  Why the fuck to the bad guys always run up.  There was nothing down.  He could get away.  Unless he didn't intend to get away.  Fuck!



# Rooftops

Garrett was hardly in shape, but he was Venatori and the demon carried his body to the roof ahead of of me without a problem.  The door swung wide and scraped against the ground in the wind.  The sun was bright but it was cool up here on the top of the AU building.

The demon's eyes were glowing red when he looked at me.  He laughed.  "I'd prefer not to die," it said to me.

"So why did you run up?"  I asked.  It was such a stupid move.

It laughed.  "I have a plan.  And you have a choice to make.  You can save the man who tormented you your whole life or you can let him die."

I frowned.  "What do you mean?"

"No more talking, boy.  I will have you back and the others too.  I will have you."  The last words were said as he stepped up on the ledge of the roof.  He turned to face me and the smile was dark and made me shudder with fear.  I couldn't help it I wanted to close my eyes and make it all go away.  The demon took a step back and  I watched as it left Garrett in a black mist just as his weight carried him backwards.

I was standing on the precipice of a decision.  I had to make a decision.  A split second decision.  There were eight seconds to the bottom, even one second delay could mean death.  I didn't think.  It wasn't because I liked the man, but I could see the fear in Garrett's eyes as he realized what had happened.  I cleared the distance to the edge at a run and dove over the edge.  One... I spearheaded my way down to Garrett I moved past him and flipped on to my back.   Two... I wove air around us and I felt my body catch against the thickening air.  Three... I sent weaves to soften the earth below earth and water to make sure it was as soft as it could be.  Four...  Garrett's body collided with mine and I wrapped my arms and legs around him and spread my weaves tighter and thicker than I had before.   Five... I didn't want to die saving this bastard.  But I couldn't let him die either without trying.   Six... He deserved to die, but not like that.  He deserved to be brought to justice, but this wasn't justice.  I was the better man.  Seven .... I was the man he made me and I would forever be grateful even to my dying day.

Eight... I felt my body collide with the earth below and I felt the bones shatter.  There was no pain... there was nothing but blackness...




# Dreams

There was pain, I could feel it.  But I didn't care.  The world around me swam with colors.  It was like the place I'd been with Dev.  Except the ground was recently tilled soil done up in neat little rows.  The trees at the edge of my sight were colorful, beautiful autumn colors, but it was warmer than expected on a cool fall day.  The sun was bright.  In the middle was a large tree barren of all leaves.  I'd seen it before.  It shifted and changed as I moved towards it.  The branches phased and changed like I was flipping a page in a book.  It was an old gnarled oak tree, the branches got thinner as it reached towards the sky but each limb was strong.  The roots were a mound of strength.

There were three knots in the tree arranged in a triangle just before the branches upwards.  I stepped onto the stone statue of a dragon at the base of the tree and ran my fingers over the gnarled knots.  The opened and three eyes stared back at me and I fell backwards landing in small pond.  Two fish swam around me, nipping, kissing at my fingers as I righted myself.  The eyes blinked at me, each a different color.  The first dark deep blue so dark and so blue I thought I would drown in the depths of the sea.  The one at the apex was green and brown with beautiful flecks of gold scatterd in their brilliance.  The last was blue like ice, but so much warmer than it.

They eyes followed my movements as I stood up.  The sun was warm and as it fell towards the ground to set into dusk it perched itself upon a branch and held itself there.  Forever on the branch caught in the branches to never set upon the world.  But it didn't struggle, it looked like it wanted to be there.

The moon rose from the never setting sun and the sky grew dark and the stars shown in the distance, the moon got caught in the branches.  Together sun and moon kissed and a baby sprang forth born of both the light and the darkness.  Above the baby hung a mobile made of bats that tried to get away but instead flew in circles entertaining the new child.

A wolf howled atop a stone outcropping nearby.  The sound reverberated through my body.  I could feel a pack nearby.  Their songs echoed back in the distance.  At the base of the tree the dragon statue sat atop a copper ring.  I bent down and ran my fingers over the shiny metal and felt my power push flee in fear.  I placed my other hand on the ring and felt the connection to the tree, to the earth, to every thing around me.

There was a peircing cry and I looked the other side of the tree to see a basket covered in red and white gingham.  A child was wrapped nestled in the basket, cold and shivering and when I lifted her from the basket the world fell away.

There was nothing in my arms.  Nothing around me but the void of dreams.  I stood in a circle.  No I floated in a sphere - the sphere Dev had shown me. But there were strings attached to me.  Some were bright and others dim.  Some were thick and old, and others were tiny but strong.

One was a vine stretching miles away.  I couldn't see anything it connected to but when I touched it I could smell the forest around me.  I could feel the wolves.  I felt the full moon rise and fall and I felt their bodies shift and change through the phases of the moon.

The thin red line looked nothing more line a peice of fishing wire except it was blood red and so thin I could almost see through it.  But no matter how hard you pulled on it the string never lost it's shape.  It didn't stretch or bend.  It was constant.

I found a thread of fire.  It was warm to the touch but not hot when I placed my hand on it I felt my little dragon holding on to his snoppy.  There were beeping sounds around him and I felt him shiver.  I let go startled from the experience.

So many connections.  The strongest ones were the ones I knew.  I could feel Sage's energy pulsing through one before I even touched it.  I could smell the scent of lavender and jasmine as I let go.  Dev light and airy, and I could hear soft sounds of music playing as I touched his chord.  It was a guitar string ironically.

I understood I was seeing connections.  How Nick saw the world.  These were mine.  Each one someone I had tied myself to.  Dee was there too but I felt nothing when I found hers.  I knew it was her, the pink glow was unique to her.  So strong, but so silent.

My father was there, and Dorian too. Jace and Adrian.  And so many other tiny connections I'd made tied to myself.  Strong and weak and some nearly broken.   I touched one of ash and it crumbled to the ground.  There was a howl of pain - my pain as I opened my eyes.

# Waking Up

The light was blaring and white.  And the sound of beeping monitors echoed in my ears like blaring alarms.  I growled at the discomfort I was in.  My arms were immobile and so were my legs.  I struggled against whatever was holding me down.  I felt a hand touch my cheek and a soft voice sounded in my ear, "Nox, darling, calm down, it's alright.  You are safe.  Calm down and I'll unbind you."

I recognized the voice and did as she asked.  I smelled roses and felt her hands work the straps on my arms first.  I laid still completely waiting for her to unbind me.  She muttered to me "Shhh.  It's okay Nox."

I opened my eyes and blinked back the tears that stung them.  I watched Dee undo the bindings on my legs.  I tried to speak but I couldn't my mouth was dry.  Dee placed a few ice chips against my lips.  I asked, "What are you doing here?"

Dee smiled.  "I'm just visiting.  But I can manage this much."

"How long have I been out of it?"

Dee raised the bed so I was sitting up.  "A few days.  Your nurse says you should be dead."

"I've heard that before."  I sighed.  "The boys okay?"

Dee nodded as she sat down in the empty chair.  "They have been staying with Kai while Sage stays in your apartment.  Dev and I stop by and visit when we aren't working."

"How many days, Dee?"

A small girl came in and I saw the purple streak in her hair.  I recognized her of course, how could I forget Madison.  She took my vitals.  "You've been in a coma for two weeks while your body healed from crushed bones and internal bleeding.  You should have died from that jump Nox.  What ever possessed you to jump?"

I frowned, "And Garrett?"

"He died on impact.  We thought you were dead too until you gasped when we pulled his dead body from the top of yours."

"Walker said you could do amazing things, but I didn't think you could do it while you were dead."

"Was I dead?" I asked.

"No one really knows.  But you should have died Nox.  There was no way you should have survived with Garrett dead on top of you."

I sighed.  "When can I go?"

Madison laughed, "Your doctor needs to see you and I don't think you'll be going anywhere soon."

"We'll keep you company.  Even your father has stopped by."  Dee said.  "He's a nice man.  The boys love him."

"They do." I said.  "He loves them."

Madison spoke at the door, "Your doctor will come by soon and see you, until then don't move and drink very little."

I nodded.  "Yes, ma'am"



# Dr. Eriksen

I waited for whoever was going to discharge me.  I wasn't going to sit here forever but when I tried to move my entire body ached.  Dee stopped me and I sighed when I laid back down.  "I guess I missed our date."

Dee laughed.  "We all missed our date."

I frowned.  "Sage and Dev didn't go see a movie?"

She shook her head, "You were in a coma."

"That doesn't mean you should stop living cause I was dying."

Dee took my hand in hers and sat down on the edge of the hospital bed.  "We didn't stop living.  Dev and Sage came here and watched a movie they had already seen to watch it with you."

A woman in white walked into the room, "It was all very sweet.  Seeing the three of them huddled around a laptop with you in the middle.  I think the nurses that day had to throw out your friends well after visiting hours were over."  She smiled at Dee and I clutched at her hand when she tried to leave.  The woman's blue eyes were like ice.  I didn't want to be left alone with her.  The patterns around her swirled and shifted and she had no control of them like most Venatori.  I couldn't look at her and had to turn my head.

Dee patted my hand and stood up but she didn't leave.  The doctor spoke again.  "I'm Dr. Eriksen.  I've been monitoring you and your miraculous recovery.  We are very glad to have you awake."

"It's good to be awake and not dead."

She let out a forced laugh. "Keep that sense of humor Mr. Sétanta."

"Nox."  I instructed and looked at her.  "So tell me doc, can I go home?"

"Sadly, Nox, no that's not possible yet.  Your muscles are showing signs of atrophy for two weeks of disuses, we want to monitor that.  You jumped from a building and we fear that you might be suffering again from depression and would like you to admit yourself into a facility suicide watch program for the next few months."

"I didn't try to kill myself.  I was saving Garrett."  I was astounded.  "It's not like it's the first time I jumped from the building."

Dee gasped.  She didn't know about me or my ability.  Dev hadn't told her?

Dr Eriksen looked at me with exasperation.  "Nox.  The only other time on medical record that you've done these things is when you admitted to trying to kill yourself."

"I was fucking 13 the last time I tried to kill myself.  It's been ten years."

"Mr. Sétanta, please. It is in your own best interest to recover appropriately and we'll watch you for any more signs of suicide.  We do not want a field hunter becoming metus."

Dee put her hand on my shoulder.  "What can it hurt Nox.  Maybe a break will be good for you?"

"A break?  You mean it's good for me to admit to trying to kill myself.  To put my self in a facility where they will keep sharp objects from me.  A place where even a pencil is dangerous.  Why do you want me to go into that hell?" I looked up at Dee.

She was frowning.  "You jumped from a building Nox.  We don't want you to hurt yourself again."

"You think I tried to kill myself?"

"I don't know, Nox.  You jumped from a building."

I looked at Dr. Eriksen as I pulled my hand from Dee's.  "Fine.  I will willingly submit to suicide watch in the Infimary's phsyce ward."

Dee gasped and she tried to take my hand again but I wouldn't let her.  Dr Eriksen nodded, "Madison will be along shortly to take you there.  She's been assisting in your care while here just in case you woke up."

The good doctor left leaving me alone with Dee.

"Nox, don't be mad at me."  Dee pleaded.

"You don't even know me and you believe them over what I'm saying.  Why shouldn't I be mad at you?"

"Nox."

"Don't.  Okay.  I'm going into the pschye ward because you think I'm trying to kill myself."  I looked at her and her green and brown eyes and saw golden flecks floating in the iris.  Fuck! I thought to myself as I recalled fleeting images from my dream.  "I've jumped from the top of the AU building since I was 10 years old.  I broke my arm doing it once because I landed wrong, and once I did it to kill myself.  But I didn't, the moment I jumped I used my ability to slow and land, I however busted my collar bone because I hadn't been fully prepared.  It was habit to spread wings of air, soften the dirt.  I wasn't going to die, my own brain wouldn't even allow me that curtousey.  Garrett Spence was posseessed by a demon.  The demon took Garrett over the edge and left his body, condemning his pawn to death if I didn't save him.  I still didn't save him but I tried."

"You died Nox.  All the emergency people were thinking it Dev said.  Everyone who say you that day had thought you were dead, and then all of a sudden you were breathing.  Your heart was beating.  No one was even sure you would wake up again.  But your body continued to heal rapidly.  The took you into surgery and you came out with no scars whatsoever.  The nurses are baffled.  If this were a human hospital they'd be freaking out."

"It's not a human hospital."  I said and rolled over and winced in pain.  Dee sat down in the chair behind me, the chair scuffed as she shifted it.  We'd wait in awkward silence until Madison returned to take me away to the fucking pschye ward.




# Empty Room

Dee sighed, "I should go.  I need to grab a shower before work."

I rolled back to lay on my back and looked at her.  Her green eyes still catching the light and I saw the golden flecks.  "Look I'm sorry.  I'm an asshole sometimes."

"You don't need to apologize, Nox.  You are right.  I'm inclined to beleive the medical professionals.  I don't know you.  But I think I speak for the boys too, that they are worried about you."

"I know.  And I'll do this for the three of you.  But I'm not suicidal.  I'm too egotistical to want to rid the world of my charm and wit."  I grinned at her.

"You sound like Dev."

"Maybe that's why we like each other."  I said.

"Sounds like a way to clash to the high heavens to me.  But he likes you too."  Dee smiled and pressed a kiss to my lips.  "I like you too.  I'll speak with Madison later and see when we can visit you.  I'll bring you some real food."

I nodded as my stomach growled in response to food.  Dee laughed.  "You have to wait until the doctor says you can eat."  She pressed another kiss to my lips and slid her tongue into my mouth.  She tasted like old bitter coffee but my body reacted to the soft scent of roses and the light touch of her breasts against my chest.  She grinned down at me, "Dev's right, you are so easy."

I rolled my eyes.  "Only for you."

"A collective you?"  She asked, "That's what Dev says right?"

"Yes."  I laughed.  "Only for the three of you."

Dee pressed her lips to my cheek and whispered into my ear.  "I'd very much like to see how easy you are.  How you well you obey so I can punish you."  My body reacted and I had to shift to be comfortable.  Dee just watched me and grinned.  "So easy."  She leaned down and whispered in my ear, "No touching unless one of the three of us is present."

I groaned, "Yes ma'am."

She left me with another kiss and then I was left in an empty room with only my hard on and the beeping monitors to keep me company.



# Moving Rooms

Madison cam into my empty room and shook her head.  "I never thought I'd see the day you had a girlfriend.  Or a boyfriend.  And you have two of them and a girlfriend."

"Jealous?" I asked with a grin as she came in and handed me a shopping bag.

"I asked Dorian to bring you some ward appropriate clothes.  He said he had to go shopping.  He didn't want to worry Sage over your stay."  She moved to the monitors and removed the wires and IV in my arm.  Her tiny hands lowered the railing with practiced movements then she took my arm.  "Let's get you changed.  Can you stand up?"

I swung my legs to the side and she she helped me stand up.  My knees buckled underneath me but she caught me with ease.  Venatori strength to the rescue, I was a foot taller than Madison and probably weighted more than she did soaking wet by a good hundred pounds.  She was just a tiny slip of thing.  "I like Sage."  She said as she helped me to the chair.  It was a test of my walking skills but we made it without another incident.  "He's shy.  Not what I expected of you."

"Yeah.  Me either.  But he makes me feel safe."  I said as I rummaged through the bag of clothes Dorian had bought me.  There were two pairs of jeans and a pair of sweat pants and a pair of shorts and several plain t-shirts of varying colors.  Plus the essential boxers and socks.  I really felt like I needed a shower, but I supposed that would have to wait for now.

"Dev and Dee are a couple?"  She asked.

"Same as Sage and I."

"How's that all work?" She asked as she helped me stand up to pull the pair of shorts on.

"Same as any relationship works I guess.  We've only been doing this for a few days for myself.  Sage has been seeing them for a while now.  And I just lost two weeks of that time so I'm a little behind on the whole building a relationship."

Madison laughed, "They've been here everyday, either all together or alone.  Dev likes to sing to you.  He's got such a good voice.  Most of the nurses have a crush on him."

"He is pretty goregous."

Madison shook her head.  "I'll never get used to that.  Knowing I was your first, but then you were jerking off to Dylan so I guess it shouldn't be a surprised.  You didn't miss anything by not sleeping with Dylan."

I laughed.  "I stopped thinking about him a long time ago.  He's not even on my radar.  He's cute, but he's an ass and I could do so much better than him."

"You did do better than him.  We are all kinda jealous.  Three gorgeous lovers for a guy who was nothing but a player."

"I'm sure you all still think I'm a player."  I grinned at her as I pulled the plain orange shirt over my head.

"I think most people are just curious how it works. Do you all share the same bed?  Always have sex together?  Or do you like date each other individually."

I shrugged.  "Honestly I don't know.  Sage and Dee have been sleeping together by themselves.  He and Dev and Dee have been together.  The four of us have spent a single night together and there was no sex.  And the only one of the three I've had sex with so far is Sage.  So really I have no idea."

A man in blue scrubs wheeled a chair into the room.  "Is he ready?"

"He is Sam."  She turned to me and helped me stand up. "Sam will take you to the ward and get you settled in.  I'll see you before dinner to get you situated."

I nodded and Sam wheeled me away to my new home for the indeterminate future.



# My New Home

Sam rolled me the infirmary elevator which wasn't the same as the elevators used by normal transport and there was little panic plus it was only up one level in some far off corner where no one really went.  Who wanted to visit the mental patients.  It was kind of amazing that the Venatori had such a place.  A place where those with mental illness could get the treatment and care they needed.  It seemed far to loving for them.  And maybe it was, or maybe someone had a heart.  But I wouldn't put it past the Venatori to be experimenting on the populace of the ward.  Testing and watching, giving drugs because the Venatori won't say no when it's other Venatori helping them out.  Stupid idiotic people.

The orderly didn't try to talk to me as he rolled me through the empty halls.  Rolling up to automatic double doors that locked as soon as they closed was disheartening.  There was no leaving without permission.  I couldn't just up and walk away.  Not that I could at the moment but I was about to have a lot of time on my hands.

The chair stopped rolling in front of the desk and a nurse came out and checked my vitals.  "Mr. Sétanta how are you feeling today?"

"It's Nox and I'm alive and awake what more could I ask for."  I grinned at the stocky woman, she wasn't fat by anymeans just more wide probably one of those tough as nurses who can put a man down in a heart beat.  "What's your name?"

She smiled at me then said, "Don't you worry about charming me, boy. You won't be seeing me any time soon."

I frowned playfully.  "And here I thought you liked me."

She grinned back and patted my head.  "Be good for the nurses and you won't see me until you leave."

I nodded. "Yes ma'am."

Sam rolled me through another set of locking automatic doors and the noise of occupancy touched my ears the moment they opened.  It was loud and I could hardly think because of it.  Sam said, "You'll get used to the noise."

"Are you sure?" I asked.

"I'm going to take you to your room, then we'll one of the nuses will walk you to the common room where you can join your group."

"My group?"  I asked.

"We have a group treatment policy.  Up to five patients who can get alone in a group to assist each other and be friends so no one is left out.  Socialization is one of the best methods for the broken mind."

"Except for those who are freaked out by being in someone elses presence I imagine."

"You aren't one of them are you?"

I laughed.  "Me?  No, never.  I thrive on being the center of attention.  I won't be surprised if everyone loves me by the end of dinner."

Sam laughed as he passed his card over a locked room.  "This is your room.  Madison had your friends bring some of your things here."  He rolled me inside and helped me stand up.  My legs were still weak and wobbly but I managed just fine to sit down on my lumpy mattress and take the surroundings in.

It was really nothing more than my studio apartment except there was no bathroom.  I had a table bolted to the floor and heavy chair that swiveled and was attached to it like you see in some of those old fashioned diners or in the cafeteria.  My bed was made up of a lumpy mattress a single white pillow and a grey blanket with white sheets.  I was betting they'd be red with blood tonight.

There was a plain metal set of drawers bolted to the wall.  The three drawers were slightly open and I could see my clothes inside.  Or more from Dorian's purchases either way.  On the desk sat a box of crayons with a note attached to it on top of several composition notebooks - no spirals here.  The lined paper would suck for drawing, so would the crayon's but Dorian knew that I'd need something to help pass the nightmares by.  Rolled in the corner was a yoga mat which I found surprising that something so simple could make me happy.

In each corner there was a black orb and a camera.  The door locked from the outside and there was a small thick glass window set in it and an intercom next to it.  At least I could talk to someone if I needed to.  The thought of being locked in this room at night made my anxiety rise.  I wasn't afraid of enclosed places but being trapped was not something I was fond of.

Sam had left me alone in the room with my thoughts.  Someone would be along he'd said before he left.  I wasn't looking forward to this at all.

# Who's That

A thin slip of a girl came into my room while I was looking around.  Her smile was perfect, her hair a perfect halo of gold around her head.  She had dimples but her eyes were dull blue with not shine or spark.  I hoped it was tired and not the norm.  "My name is Sara I'll be one of the nurses assiting in your care."

"Nox."  I introduced myself despite the fact she knew who I was and probably more about me than I cared for.  But such was the name of being under suicide watch.

She asked me as she stood beside me, "Do you want to try to walk on your own?"

I nodded.  "Yeah."  I did my best to stand up and I was caught by the little slip of a girl when my knees gave way.  "Don't I feel like an idiot.  Can't even walk."

Sara smiled, "That's what happens when you've been lying in bed for two weeks."

"I guess.  I take it there will be PT?"

"Yes.  And Madison said that knowing you, you'll be up and about in no time."  She glanced at the yoga mat rolled up in the corner. She pointed to a rod bolted to the wall.  "That should hold you.  We have them in all the rooms now."

"Isn't that a little counter productive, I mean I could use my sheets and hang myself now."

She paled at the suggestion.  "You are on suicide watch?"

I nodded.  "It's the only reason why I'm here."

"You don't look like a guy who wants to kill himself."

"I'm not but that doesn't stop the doctors from thinking that."  Or my girlfriend for that matter I sighed.

Sara helped me waddle along the hall, my hand in hers as she held my waist and my other hand skimmed along the wall.  We past a room with a boy who was screaming.  I could see the patterns swirling around him like a chaotice storm.  I stopped and Sara jerked my waist with the suddenness of it.

"What's that?"

She sighed, "Don't worry about Levi.  They are just giving him his meds, he'll calm down soon enough."

"What's wrong with him?" I asked as Sara tugged me towards the common area.

"He's a little bit crazy.  And very dangerous.  We don't have many Magnus here to work with him, but he can get out of control."

"I noticed."

She looked up at me with a frown, "You aren't going to go all crazy on us are you.  I don't think our Magnus could handle you."

I shook my head, "No more crazy than I already am I'm afraid."

She grinned at me and then pointed down the hall.  "The dinning room is down this way.  You'll get used to the schedule in now time."





# Meeting the Group

Sara took me to a group sitting around a table filled with art supplies.  Mostly drawing, but there was paints and various other things too.  Sara smiled, "Today is art day.  I believe tomorrow you have movie day."

One of the girls sitting at the table clapped her hands.  "We'll even let the newbie pick."

I raised my eyebrow as Sara sat me down in an empty chair next to the giddy one.  Sara put her hands on my shoulders, "Guys, this is Nox.  He'll be staying with us a while.  He's on watch so we need all of you to assist in keeping him safe."

I rolled my eyes and the big black man next to me laughed.  It was like rolling thunder yet it was very calming to see the big man happy.  "I don't think he likes that statement much." He waved his hands.  "Shoo, little miss, we got him."  When Sara left she squeezed my shoulders wishing me luck.  Or that's what I assumed.  The big black man offered me his hand.  "I'm Duke.  This is Lori."  He pointed at the giddy girl with brown hair.  She couldn't be more than 18.

Duke pointed at the other girl sitting at the table, her head was hung, her hair covering her face and she sat with her hands in her lap like she was ignoring the world.  "That's Jo.  She doesn't talk much."

There was a man sitting behind an easle painting, I couldn't see what he was doing, but he was a tad bit angry.  "That's Cliff."

Cliff was scowling at me so I asked, "What's wrong?"

"You are sitting in Amelia's seat."

I stood up and nearly collapsed the moment I did so.  Fuck!  "Yeah sorry."  I used a weave of air and dragged another chair closer.  I slide into the seat and  moved it closer to the table.

"Who's Amelia?" I asked.

Lori giggled, "Cliff's imaginary friend."

I looked at the empty chair.  I offered her my hand and pulled the invisible friend's hand to my lips and pressed a kiss to the third knuckle  "A pleasure Amelia."  I turned to Cliff with a smile.  "Do you see anyone else?"

Cliff nodded, "There have been others, but in here there is only Amelia."

"Did you meet her here?  Or did she come with you?"

"She was here.  She likes you."

I grinned, "I've never met a woman I cant make like me."

Duke shook his head, "We aren't supposed to help along our delusions."

"Why do you assume he's seeing things that aren't real?  Seeing ghosts is not a normal Venatori talent, but it's a talent none the less.  If no one beleives you I can see how one would think you are crazy."

Cliff sighed and came around the table and wrapped his arms around my neck.  "All the voices that I hear drove me to this point.  It's quieter here.  I don't want to leave.  Don't make me leave."

I shook my head.  "I'm not going to tell anyone.  But I'd like to know more about Amelia and why she's here.  She could be trapped inside while the other ghosts are trapped outside."

Cliff shook his head and went back to his painting.  "Leave it be, boy.  Nothing here needs fixing."

That didn't sound at all like Cliff from before.  Sounded very much like a possessed man.  Cliff's body slumped and then he was back to his self I could see it in the patterns around him.  I looked around trying to see the spirits here.  There were at least two.  I wondered what had happened.



# Phone Calls

My afternoon played out in the common room around a table with four people I didn't know real well.  Jo reminded me of home.  But I never got her to open up.  She was looking up now, which was good.  I hadn't been bragging when I said I could make most women like me.  I was good at being what they wanted.  That whole please my partner thing shining through even though I wasn't thinking about it that way.  I missed Sage.  I wished I'd seen him before coming here.

Sam the orderly came into the common room and stopped at our table. "Nox you have a phone call.  Do you need assistance?"

Duke stood up.  "I'll show him the way."

Duke grabbed me by the arm and pulled me up.  Not only was he big he was strong, much stronger than any Venatori I knew.  I didn't so much as walk as I was dragged to a different room with a bunch of phones and booths for privacy.  There was one off the hook.  It was such an old school design I was almost afraid to touch the handset for all the germs.  But this was a hospital still, everything was likely cleaner than the outside world.

Duke sat me in the share.  "I'll wait over there."  He pointed to a place with a couch and some magazines.

I picked up the phone.  "Hello?"

"Nox!"  There was a sign of relief when Sage's voice called out my name.  "Are you alright?"

"I'm fine love.  I'm sorry."  I said.  I didn't want to make a big deal of this but I wanted to hear his voice so bad.  I wanted to kiss him and touch him and I was stuck inside this stupid place alone and without my wicked truth.

"Don't do that again."  He said with rage.  "You scared the hell out of us.  The boys are finally home with me, Matt too.  Dev and Dee are here too.  How long can you talk?"

I shrugged.  "I don't know."

Duke laughed from the couch, "As long as you want lover boy."

"Apparently as long as I want."

Sage chuckled.  "Who was that?"

"That was Duke who is like 10 feet away from me listening to our conversation."

"We could give him something to listen to."

I glanced over at Duke who was covering his face with a magazine pretending he wasn't listening to everything I said to Sage.  I asked, "You okay?"

"I'm fine.  Did you really try to kill yourself?"  Sage asked.

"Why the fuck would I want to kill myself, Sage? When I have Drake and Fae who need me.  And Matt to look after.  Not to mention I'd be leaving you behind.  And I'd never get to know Dev and Dee."

"I'm sorry, Nox.  Everyone says you jumped."

"I did jump, love.  But I was trying to save Garrett not kill myself."

"Why would you save that bastard after what he did to you?"  His voice rose in rage and I could hear Dev in the background, but I couldn't make out what he'd said.

"It's hard to explain Sage.  But the demon stepped off the side of the building and left Garrett to die.  It doesn't matter how many horrible things he's done to me, he's still innocent.  He was being murdered by something worse than him."

"He beats fucking children Nox."

"I know."

There was a scuffle on the other side and then Dev's voice came over the phone, "He needs to relax a little, he's making the lights flicker.  I don't think I've ever seen anything like it.  Dee's taking him upstairs for a bath.  You okay?"

"I'm fine."  I snapped.  I hated that I was upset.

"Tonight, I'm going to visit you if that's alright?"  Dev's voice raised at the end in question.

"I can't stop you even if I said no."

Dev chuckled and it made me smile.  "Actually, I need you to let me in.  I tried to get in while you were in the coma.  But your shields kept me out.  Did you have nightmares?"

I shook my head.  "No.  I only remember a few snippets.  Like I'd had the dreams before though."

"That's a good thing.  Tonight, think of me when you go to sleep.  Focus on me and I can get in."

I laughed, "That shouldn't be hard.  Or maybe it is."

Dev chuckled, "I should go check on the boys.  Do you want to say hi?"

"No.  Can you give them a hug for me though?"  I asked.

"I think I can manage that.  Though I think I'll refrain from hugging Matt if that's alright."

"Is he crushing on you?"  I asked.

"No.  Touching him blanks the world out.  It's disorienting."

"Does it now?"  I said.  "He's a ground for my power, I didn't think it worked on other abilities.  He is a true null then."

"What the fuck is a null pretty boy?"

I grinned at the nick name and whispered into the phone, "I can't wait to hear you say that to me in a whisper against my lips."

Dev chuckled.  "Answer my question, pretty boy."  There was a small hit of a command in his voice and he knew it and I bit back a groan which made Dev laugh just a little bit more.

"A null is a person who nullifies all magic.  He doesn't know how to control it which is why he nulls your telepathy.  He can control the magnus ability because he can see the patterns, knows he'd doing something.  He figured it out.  Nulling your powers must come as a defense mechanism."

"I can read him just fine most days."

I laughed, "But not everyday like me, or Sage?"

"Exactly.  Sometimes he's just not there."

"He's hiding something, or wants to keep a secret so he kills your power so you can't read him.  It's a defense mechanism.  He probably doesn't know.  Sit down and talk with him about it.  Play with it.  If you are willing.  Matt needs to learn about his ability and there are no teachers for such a thing.  It's going to be all trial and error."

Dev sighed.  "I'll see.  Not sure I like the idea that one of you can just take my power away."

"Imagine what that can mean though.  If we can train other nulls, we could take more supernatural creatures who need rehabilitiation and we could make them safe to be around while they learn to control their impulses.  Less killing.  More helping."

"Nox the hero.  I swear if you jump off another building to save a man like Garrett our boyfriend is going to flip his lid and we might not have any power in the City if he does that."

"I'll do my best not to hurt myself lover.  I promise, but I can't say I won't try to save someone like that again."

Dev sighed.  "I know.  Sage knows this is who you are.  We kinda love the man you are."

"You love me?"

"You heard that huh?"  Dev sighed.  "I don't know.  I know he loves you.  I know there is something between us even though we don't know each other well.  I've never been able to read someone as well as I can read you.  Not Sage, Not Dee.  Something is different."

"You can't read Dee."  I stated.  I bit my bottom lip at the thought he and I had a special thing going on.  I wasn't going crazy.

"And Sage has this inherint shield too.  Most people only have trivial thoughts that I can pick up on.  You I don't even have to dig to hear things.  You shield better than most people.  I've noticed that.  When I look the shields around people, your's is strong and much stronger now with out all those holes, yet I hear you.  Now on the phone it's like I can hear your thoughts.  You are thinking about how you noticed it too.  How there is a connection but you can't explain it."

"I am."

"I know.  I can feel it even if I can't read it directly.  I don't know what this is Nox.  But pretty boy, we can talk about it tonight.  I need to see you.  I need to check on the boys, they wanted to talk to you but I think they got wrapped up in their video games."

I chuckled.  "I'll see you tonigt, Dev.  Kiss Dee and Sage for me and hug the boys."

"Of course pretty boy.  See you tonight."

He hung up and I was left with dead air.  Then the dial tone beeped in my ear and I slammed the phone down.  Duke jumped at the sound.  He chuckled, "You and your boys done talking?"

I nodded.  "Yeah.  What's next on our agenda?"

"Dinner." He said.  "Well in about 10 minutes.  We can go now though."

I nodded, "Sounds great.  I'm starving."



# Dinner Time

Duke helped me to the dining room.  It was far nicer than the cafeteria was in te common area of the AU building.  The tables were round and white linen table clothes each seat with five place settings.  The chairs were all padded and nice.  It almost looked like we were in some posh restaurant.  I wondered if the food here was any good.

Duke sat me down in a chair then sat across from me with a white toothy grin.  "Cliff is going to be angry you are sitting in Amelia's chair."

I laughed.  "She can sit in my lap.  I won't mind - honest."

Duke shook his head.  "A little horn dog aren't you?"

"Yes."  I nodded.  "Very much so.  And I haven't gotten any in two weeks."

"The shock of it."  A familiar voice sounded.  "I'm sure it has nothing to do with the fact that you've been in a coma for two weeks."

"None at all."  I grinned at Madison as she set a paper cup and pills down in front of me.

I looked up at her and frowned, "What's this?"

"Your medication."

"I don't need medication.  None of that shit works on me."  I said with venom in my voice.  Margo had tried years upon years ago to give me drugs for my issues.  But my body burned off the human doses for the same conditions and the Venatori metabolism can't handle those drugs and I saw things when I had Venatori medication.  Not a pleasant situation either which way.

"Dr. Eriksen and Dr. Watson beleive it is for the best.  You need to take them.  Everyone takes their medication."

Duke frowned.  "It's better just to do it.  I'll make sure they don't do anything inappropriate if you have an unfavorable reaction."

I looked up at Madison and frowned.  "Fine."  I took the pills and downed them without water.  I felt a slight constriction in my throat as they passed and then there was nothing like I'd imagined the slight I can't breath moment.  "If I get loopy I will not be held responsible for my actions."

Madison nodded the purple strand falling in front of her face.  "I understand Nox.  Food will be on the way when everyone else gets here."

Lori and Jo filed in next, both taking a between Duke and myself.  Jo sat next to me.  She didn't look up and she kept her hands to herself.  I turned in my chair towards her and put my hand on her knee.  She jumped at my touch and I pulled my hand back just as quick.  There had been a sharp jolt when we touched.  I could smell the damp musty smell of forest undergrowth and then it was gone on the currents of the wind. I reached across the way and touched Jo's chin and there was a sharp zap and she looked up at me with fear.  "I'm sorry about that."  I said but I didn't let go this time.

Her eyes dropped to my hand but she didn't bow her head again.  "Why are you here?"

Lori interrupted, "It's not nice to ask that."

I frowned.  "I'm sorry but I need to know."

Duke's voice was low and gruff in a whisper and it sent a shiver down my spine. This was a man who could break me in half yet I was certain he was just a soft cuddly man who wouldn't hurt a fly.  "Jo's in for violent tendancies."

Lori sighed.  "She was found in a mall tearing apart the dressing rooms.  She was so strong, and so violent the Venatori stepped in.  But she's not one of us."

I shook my head, "She's a wolf."

"How do you know?"  Lori asked as she edge the chair a little bit away from Jo.

I pulled Jo's chair towards me and touched her knee.  "It's okay."  I looked at Lori and smiled.  "I just know."

"How long has she been here?"  I asked.

"A few months."

"Good."  I tried to stand up but fell back to my seat when my knees buckled.  "Fuck!" I whispered to myself.  I was going to have to do something about this soon rather than later.  I couldn't stand not moving under my own power when I wanted.

Dinner arrived before I could figure out what to do.  Cliff had arrived only moments before the plates were set in front of us.  No one had the same thing, my plate looked the blandest of them all.  Chicken and vegetables and a dinky little roll.

Lori giggled.  "We'll get your list to the cooks and you can have what we want."  She dug into her pancakes piled high and topped with strawberries.

I looked around and saw most everyone was eating burgers or pizza or any various other things.  This was some place.  Almost literally a restaruant for the crazy.  I wondered who did all the cooking and if I could help...

# Rehabilitation

We all chatted, well mostly I talked, they asked questions.  They probably knew my whole life's story in that one sitting.  Seems the new guy always got grilled.  But it didn't feel like that.  But then again I was used to spilling my guts  with everything.  It tended to just fall out.

I didn't learn anything new about Jo, or anyone else.  Cliff's Amelia sat in my lap.  It was an enjoyable conversation I had with myself and Cliff.  He even helped me to my room.  Amelia stayed behind said she was going to watch my back.  I wasn't exactly sure why that was but since I couldn't see her I doubted whatever she wanted to protect me from I could see either.  I did wonder if Cliff was crazy or not.  Or if he really did see ghosts.  Hell of a gift to be a medium and then everyone disbeleive you and call you crazy.

I tried to stand and walk and all I managed was to sink to my knees.  Crawling would have to do I wasn't about to scream for assistance.  I should have gone to sleep but without Sage or Dev I was actually a little afraid to do so.  Even here where I should be safe I didn't feel it.  I used a wisp of air to unfurl the yoga mat not to far from my bed.  I may not be able to stand yet but I was sure I could do some yoga to calm down and relax.

It wasn't lights out yet. And the longer it grew from dinner the more I found myself drifting into a drowsy state.  Whatever they had given me was making me tired.  But I powered through the sitting and kneeling yoga moves then  moved into some bodyweight exercises.  A pushup was difficult but I did manage it, without any real assistance.  My core was still relatively strong, just my legs.  And that was difficult without any standing.

But I wove air around me and I used that to assist.  I don't know why I didn't think of it earlier.  I didn't need assistance from anyone I could do it myself.

I heard a large shrill buzz and then a voice over the intercom, "Lights Out."  I'd spent at least three hours zoned out in Yoga.  That was unusual.  I would need to ask about that.  I didn't like this medication if I was going to lose time.

I laid down in my lumpy bed and wrapped the blankets around me.  I wrapped the elements around me to comfort me.  I could feel the warmth from my ability coursing through me.  I wished it was Sage or Dev.  I wondered to myself when Dee would fit that comfort bill, if she ever would.  I was pretty sure Dee wasn't going anywhere.

I closed my eyes and imagined the warmth around me was Dev.  I wanted to see Dev.  I needed to see him.  I wondered what kind of dream I'd have with him and his baby blue eyes and inky hair that I wanted to run my fingers through...

# Dreams of Dev

There was darkness when I drifted to sleep.  It wasn't the same kind I remembered.  It was quiet and still but I wasn't afraid.  There was no fog, or red glow.  I floated in the nothingness.  It was eirie.  I felt things shift.  In the blackness there was solid ground.  I thought of Dev.  Of his blue eyes.  The color of his hair.  The way he smelled.  I felt a presence and it made me shiver.  It was dark and cold and I tried to push it away but it didn't come near. I shivered and thought of Dev wrapping his arms around me.  I forgot why I had been thinking of him specifically.  Why not Sage or Dee?

There darkness grew lighter and I felt warmth on my skin.  It was like watching a sunrise but there was no sun.  Just the colors changing the sky.

In the distance a figure approached.  It was blurry, like I was seeing a mirage.  It walked towards me coalesing as it came near.  I was sitting on the ground, a red picinic blanket below me.  A tree behind me with a dragon statue at the base.  I leaned back against the trunk and looked up.  I remembered the dream.  I'd had it before.  Not this dream, but these images.  I'd seen them all before.  But I couldn't remember them, couldn't remember how I knew I'd had this dream before.

The figure that walked towards me was standing in front of me.  He wore jeans and a t-shirt.  His feet were bare and I could imagine the feel of the cool grass on his feet. Where had the grass come from?  He sat down and smiled.  No it wasn't a smile it was a smirk.  He was laughing at me for some reason.  I grinned at him and patted the blanket next to me.

He knelt down next to me and splayed his body along the red blanket and leaned his head on his hand so he was propped up looking up at me.  "Interesting choice."

I shrugged.  "I didn't do anything.  I've seen it all before."

Dev laid back, looking up into the tree branches.  I scooted down to do the same, my head resting on a large root from the three we were staring into.  "Is it always like this?  In your head?"  He asked.

"I don't know."  I shrugged.  "It's always dark.  It was dark until you came."

"This tree is kinda creepy.  Those knots look like eyes."

I smiled.  "They are eyes."

Dev rolled back to his side and proped his head up on his hand and looked down at me.  "Is this what you are wearing outside?"

I looked down and saw a pair of shorts and the same t-shirt I had worn in the hospital. "Yeah."

Dev smiled, a real smile.  "Your control of the dream plane is pretty good.  Most people choose a favorite.  And I know Dorian just bought these for you."

"How do you know that?"  I asked.

Dev chuckled.  "Because he asked us what you'd be most comfortable in.  Asked Sage, but Dee and I were there too."  There was silence after that.  Dev staring down at me grinning.  I looked up at him and knew I wanted to kiss him.  Dev's grin turned to a smirk, "I can read your face as well as your mind.  I can't read you here, but I know that look."

"What looks is that?"  I asked him.  Though I was thankful my thoughts were my own right now.  Maybe it was because he was in my dream.  Whatever it was, this was mine.  I felt at peace under this barren tree in this strange place with it's lights and stars.

"The look that says I want to kiss you."  Dev said as he leaned down and pressed his lips to mine.  It was soft and gentle and he tasted the way he smelled.  I let out a small moan and Dev moved on top of me.  His body pressing mine into the gnarled roots below the blanket.

We broke apart and Dev rolled off of me.  "We should be good."

I sighed.  "Sage said it was alright.  Said we could be alone, you and I.  Me and Dee.  Individuals not just couples."

Dev grinned down at me.  "I'm glad that's all cleared up now, but we still need to be good."

I asked, "Why's that?"

Dev frowned.  "There are other things about. Trying to get in.  Don't you feel it?"

I sighed.  "That's how it always feels."

Dev sat up and looked down at me.  "You feel like someone's always trying to break in?"

I nodded.  "Yeah."

"Nox that isn't good." Dev's voice was filled with venom.  "That thing you killed.  What was it?"

I shrugged.  "A mara - nightmare embodiement I think."  I shook my head.  "I really don't know."

"Is there one here?"

"One where?"  I asked.

"In the ward with you?"

I shook my head.  "I don't know I can't see them. "

Dev sighed.  "There is something other than your normal presense though.  Can't you feel it?"

"It's probably just ghosts.  There is a medium in here, with I presume a ghost friend watching over him.  He said she said she was going to watch my back.  I don't know why she'd do that."

"You think there is a ghost there?  Could there be more than one?"

I shrugged.  "I don't know Dev.  I don't see ghosts.  I can only hunt them if the are possessing a human body."

Dev took my hand and stood up.  "Come on."

"Where are we going?" I asked as I stood up and the world shifted.


# Ghosts and Maras

Dev's hand was warm in mine.  His fingers twined around mine and he felt safe as he reached past the veil of this world into the next and stepped through.  My mind swirled with colors and notions and I wasn't sure what was happening.  I felt nausous.  My stomach recoiling much like it does when Ant steps through the shadows.

There was a cool hand at the small of my back, but Dev was holding my hand, it was still warm.  I turned to see a woman in a long maroon dress with a eighteen hundreds bustle look - petticoats and all.  Her blonde hair was in ringlets and her make up was subtle.  She smiled at me and her hand passed through my cheek leaving a cool tingle behind.  "You must be Amelia."

She smiled with a nod.  Dev looked at me and frowned.  "This is a ghost?"

Her smile spoke volumes I heard a faint whisper on the wind.  "She says yes.  It's the closest she can come to letting me see her."  Her hand passed through ours and the whisper spoke again.  "She says holding hands isn't necessary."

Dev's fingers squeezed tighter and so did mine.  I smiled at the ghost of Amelia.  "It is for us.  It's comfort."

She smiled and nodded.

I looked around and there was lots of bubbles floating around.  Dev was looking around and pulled me close.  His body pressed against mine as he wrapped a hand around my waist.  It wasn't about anything other than comfort.  His body was tense and I could smell the fear wafting from him.  It was all I smelled it covered everything.  Dev whispered, "Why is it so cold?"

Amelia whispered on the wind, "He is here."

Dev looked at the ghost and frowned.  "Who is here?"

Amelia pointed at a black bubble.  "He is."

Dev reached out for the bubble and we were standing next to it.  Neither us or the bubble moved it just was.  Amelia floated just above the bubble and looked afraid.  "Away." She said on the wind.  "Before it comes."

Darkness shrouded us, like a cloud passing in front of the sun.  But more like an eclipse, complete and total darkness.  Amelia screamed and then it cut off abruptly.  I saw the red glow of familiar eyes, yet I new they weren't the same.  The white tooth grin from the creature dripped with green ooze and it looked at me like I was it's next meal.  "Mine."  It said with a growl.

I looked inside the dark bubble and saw a boy screaming, his body flayed all but his face.  He was ashen white from the pain, but his face was perfect - untouched from the fear.  I recognized him.  I'd seen him before in my dreams.  I'd seen him before - the boy in the ward - the one down the hall.

I turned to Dev and pressed a kiss to his lips.  "Tell Dorian and Sage to search for Levi.  He's in here with me.  And Amelia too."  Dev nodded and I continued.  "Wake up lover.  Put me back in my dream and wake up.  Don't stay here.  You need to be safe."

Dev frowned but it wasn't but a moment when I was back in my room in the ward and Devin was gone with a smile and a wave and press of his lips to mine.  I opened my eyes and I felt my heart in my throat, my palms were sweaty.  I didn't know what time it was, but there was no way I was going back to sleep now.

# Breakfast

Between the time I had woken up and I was able to actually leave my room had been enough time to get in another longer workout and I found I was able to walk a lot better.  Still weak and it strained my muscles but thank god for Venatori metabolism and healing power.  I was thankful for that.  I walked under my own power past the room with the screaming boy.  He wasn't there which concerned me.  But there was no one around ask.  The hall was conviently empty.  I leaned against the wall to see if someone would happen by but Jo walked past me with her head down cast.

I caught up with her but she didn't even look at me as we walked down the hall.  She tried to speed up but I kept pace.  I grinned. "I'll make you talk to me eventually."

Jo didn't look at me but she sat down next to me without hesitation. "I can help you," I whispered to her before the others joined.  Cliff was absent which was concerning too.  Why were people missing.  First the boy, now Cliff.

Lori was her chipper self as she sat down all bubbly and bouncy.  I almost wanted to get sick she was so sweet.

Madison showed up at our table with our medication.  I rolled my eyes but said nothing as I swallowed the throat constricting pills.  It was the same sensation but I couldn't exactly prove it so I didn't say anything.  I knew my body better than that, I knew I wasn't imagining it but it was gone before I could even mention it.  I would be crying wolf.  And I didn't do that.

Cliff came out as they were serving breakfast.  I didn't even see what was in front of me when the server set it down I was consumed with Cliff's red eyes.  "What's wrong?"  I asked him.

"Amelia..."

"What happened?"  I asked more concerned that the ghost had done something stupid than something happening to her.  I mean what could happen to a ghost?

"She's dead."  Cliff cried.

"How?  She's a ghost."  I said.

Cliff's voice cracked as he spoke.  "I found her lying on my bed just lying there covered in black veins."

I inhaled sharply.  "Fuck me..."

Everyone at the table was staring at me.  "What?"

"What's wrong?"  Duke's voice rumbled with concern.

"I can't say for certain.  But I saw Amelia last night.  Darkness was swallowing us so I told my friend to take me home and leave himself.  I figured Amelia would do whatever it was she'd do.  There was a mara there."

The word didn't seem to phase any of them.  I sighed and I wasn't going to get much help here now that I was in the crazy ward.  I was going to be deemed crazy.  Ghosts and maras and dreamwalkers.  What the fuck?  And a wolf girl who no one knew was a wolf.  How stupid were people?

I don't think it had to do with stupidity.  More with ignorance - they just didn't understand the world outside.  Inside the Venatori were so ingrained in tradition, things outside of it were ignored.

I barely noticed the frittata on my plate.  It wasn't very good, I barely tasted it.  But I ate, my body needed fuel.  I had to get a computer.  I had to do some research.  Fuck, how was I going to figure this out?



# Trades

I started asking around about how I could get some computer time and I was repeatedly asked when is your group's time?  I had no idea.  No one gave me a schedule, which meant that it looked like I got it many an hour or so day.  Lori said we could go just before lunch.  I sighed and waited as we sat in front of the TV and had control of the channel.  Everything was scheduled including who controled the TV.  I didn't care and I found out quickly I could sell my time slot for junk food.  Not that I wanted that.

Duke laughed when I held on to the bag of unopened chips I'd sold my time slot for.  "You can sell that too if you aren't going to eat it?"

"For what more junk food?"

Duke shook his head.  "You'll be surprised what someone will sell there time for?"

"You mean I could buy more computer time with junk food?"

Duke nodded.  "Yes. If that's what you want to do with your new found fame."

I smelled Madison come into the room.  He hand slid to my should, "You have an appointment."

I sighed.  "My life sucks."  I stood up and followed Madison to a small room and sat down in the empty room.  "And they are late."  I hated when people were late.



# Dr. Margo Silverman

The room was small that I waited in.  A comfortable couch, faux leather and you sank in deep.  It was like wrapping up in a leather pillow.  But it smelled like so many other people I wanted to gag.  I hated when smells overpowered everything.  I had to take a few deep breathes to calm my anxiety.  There was no smoke or bad trigger smells, but they were all so overwhelming I had to sit on the edge of the couch while I waited.

Across from the couch was a comfortable chair, but it wasn't the same sink into the leather.  It was clearly a therapy room that much I was familiar with.  Suicide watch - I hated it.  I was not going to be allowed knives or string, or pencils and pens or any sharp objects.  I was surprised they weren't drugging me so I couldn't touch the elements.  I wove four balls - one for each element - just to test my theory.

I juggled the four colored orbs in the air when the door opened.  I dropped them and the weaves shattered on the floor leaving nothing but wisps of magic to spark away.  Standing inside the opened door was a blond haired blue eyed woman I hadn't seen in several months.  I moved as far from the door as physicall possible and still remain on the couch.

Dr. Margo Silverman's black wire frame glasses were perched on her nose as always.  She set down a candle and waved her hand and a single flame wicked on the candle and there was an instant smell of vanilla in the air.  She sat her breifcase down next to the chair while I stared at her.  She took out a manilla folder and set it on the couch across from her.  My name was on the tab.

There was a yellow notepad and a black pen in her hand as she took her seat.  I swallowed hard.  I hadn't seen Margo in months.  My heart was racing.  My palms were sweating.  I didn't know why I was afraid.

Margo looked at me and frowned.  "Nox.  What's wrong?"

I shook my head.  "I don't know."  I said. And Margo's frown deepened, but she didn't say anything, she let me processes my feelings.  But I wasn't having any.  I was blank, empty.

We sat in silence for several minutes.  "Is talking to me difficult."

I shook my head but I couldn't speak, my throat was dry, my hands still shaking.

"I'm only here to transition you to another therapist."

"I don't want another therapist."  I said.

"But you aren't coming to see me.  You clearly need one."  She sighed, "Why did you jump?"

"I was saving Garrett.  I wasn't trying to kill myself."  I could feel the fury rising again.  How could she think I would kill myself.  "You of all people should know I didn't try to kill myself."

Margo smiled at me.  "Why would you save him, Nox?"

"Because he was innocent in that moment.  He was duped by the demon who had possessed him, he took him over the edge and left Garrett as he fell to the ground."

"That doesn't explain why you would save your tormentor."

"I'm nothing without Garrett's teaching."  I whispered.

"You would have found the same footing, Nox.  We all know it.  You know it."

I shook my head.  "No.  He taught me control.  He taught me the same control he has.  Dae'lin doesn't have it, Margo.  I'd be like every other Venatori out there. I'd be nothing without him."

"And you risked your life for a man you despise."

I nodded. "I'm a better man than he is."

Margo smiled.  "You can see why so many people think you jumped to kill yourself.  Garrett died, Nox.  You didn't save him.  You were on the bottom.  You are here because they can't fathom how you survived."

"I can't help with that.  But I didn't try to kill myself.  I was willing to die for my principles, but I didn't go in trying to kill myself."

"Nox, Your friends are worried about you."

"What friends?" I asked with venom.

"You have friends Nox."  She said but she made a note.  "You were telling me about a boy before with sapphire blue eyes.  And there is Dorian and Jace and Mia.  They are all your friends."

"So you've been talking with them?"  I asked.

Margo frowned, "I've not spoken to anyone other than Dorian for months.  They fall to your favor of avoiding me.  I wouldn't let Dorian avoid me."

"So how do you know they are worried?"

"I saw your friends waiting in your room.   I beleive your records show you had Anthony Giovanni, Adrian Sheridan, and Domonic Olmos among the visitors.  I didn't speak with anyone other than Dorian.  But I remember your blue eyed boy and he seemed very close with two others."

I nodded.  "Dev and Dee."

"You know?"

"Yes.  He's been dating them for a while.  I've met them.  I like them."  I grinned at her.

"I'm not sure I understand Nox."

"Sage is a voyeure.  He wants more than I can give him. He's happier with Dev and Dee in our life.  Dev has been helping me.  He's got the same talent Sage has that allows me to sleep.  Dee is Dev's strength and I don't really know her, I kinda missed our date."

"Why did you miss your date?"  Margo asked.  She made a note on her legal pad.

"I was in a coma."

She laughed and scratched out her note.  "That's a good excuse."  She looked at me and tapped her pen to her bottom lip.  "Nox.  Tell me how you are doing - really doing?"

"I'm fine, Margo.  I'm talking to you which is an improvement if you ask me."

She smiled but it was sad.  "What are your thoughts on what happened at your birth?"

"My thoughts on you killing my sister?"  I asked.  Margo nodded.  "You killed my sister.  I had a fucking sister!  And you killed her!  She was a baby.  She didn't do anything wrong."

"But the Venatori would use the child."

"Who the fuck does the Venatori not use?  You killed the wrong one!"  I tried not to snap but I failed miserably.

"It's tradition."  She said as if that saved her from the consequences of her action.

"Fuck tradition!"  I stood up to walk out.  I tried the door knob but it wouldn't budge.

Margo's voice was quiet, "They won't let you out till the hour is up. Sit back down Nox."

I turned around and stared down at the woman who I'd thought of fondly for most of my life and I was staring at a stranger.  She didn't look up at me but asked another question.  "What do you think of the fact that The Dragon controlled you?"

"I don't know.  What should I think?  I broke his control.  I'm not a fucking dragon."

Margo looked up her eyes were full of fear.  "You aren't a dragon.  You aren't born from a human dragon pairing.  You were controlled by the oldest dragon known to be able to do that.  You broke that control Nox.  You don't think anything of that."

I shrugged.  "I'm fucking special, what can I say."

Margo sighed.  "You don't beleive that."

"You are right, I don't beleive I'm special.  Improbable yes.  Special no.  Everything has an explanation.  We just don't know it."

"The dragons are afraid of you  Nox."

I smiled.  "Good."  There was an electric buzz and I turned the door knob.  "I don't want to see you again Margo.  I don't need a therapist.  I'm doing fine without one."

Margo shook her head.  "It's me.  Or Dr. Watson.  I can transition you him, but it woul work better if I stayed on, Nox."

"Whatever."  I said as I strod away.



# Computer Time

I found my little group in front of the computers.  I sighed with my loss of time because I had to deal with Margo.  I was going to have to deal with Margo or some therapist while I stayed here.  I should have told her about Levi.  I should have said something about Jo.  But I forgot.  I didn't think past my own rage.

The computers in the computer room were archaic things by any standards.  Big tube screens, old school internet.  This wasn't going to work for me.  I was surprised we didn't have dial up.  What was this the 90s?

There was a nurse, or IT nobody sitting at the front desk with his feet up on the desk and his nose in a comic book pretending he was reading som other book like anyone in a mental facility cared what you read.  But I guess when you think appearances mean something you do what you have to do.  I felt out of place, out of my own skin here.  I had no make up and my nails were chipping.  The only thing good was I could do my hair however I wanted, they couldn't take that from me.

I cleared my throat when the boy at the desk ignored me.  His little heart jumped and his feet slammed to the floor like I'd caught him doing something he wasn't supposed to be doing.  I asked with a grin, "Can I get into any of the archives from here?"

He raised an eyebrow, "Why would you want to do that?"

"A little light reading, what can I say."  I lied.

"No one reads that for fun."

I smiled at him.  "I do."  And I had as a child.  My reading was limited.  I read the accountings of hunters, and the histories of man.  I read whatever they'd let me take back to my room.

"The digital archives can't be reached from here.  And I can't get you any of the old texts from the Archives.  Talk to the librarian."

"Can I do that now?" I asked.  "While I'm supposed to be here?"

He shrugged and picked up his book.  "I only run the lab I don't know what you can and can't do."

I frowned and sat down having been so rudely dismissed.  I wanted to run a weave past the boy's chair and tip him backwards.  That would teach him, but I didn't.  I behaved myself.  So proud of myself.

I sat down next to Jo who was playing a game of solitaire.  "Can I go to the library or do I have to wait?"

Duke chuckled.  "Computers not good enough for you?"

I shook my head.  "I need to get into the Archives, can't do this from here.  I'll do it the old fashioned way even if it's slower."

"You can't go to the library now.  After this when it's free time."  Jo said softly into her computer screen.

I reached across the distance and placed my hand on her knee.  "Thanks."  There was a soft spark and Jo turned to look at me, her brown eyes were almost golden and the smell of forest swept through the air.  She looked at me without fear for the first time since I'd met her.  "You feel it too?"

She nodded.  "I don't know what it means."

I smiled.  "Did you know your parents?"  I asked.  There were a lot of reasons why a twenty something might not know she was a werewolf and found here in the pschye ward of the Infirmary guarded by a bunch of idiot Venatori.

Jo shook her head.  "My parents died when I was young. Car crash."

"I'm sorry."  I said.  It was tough losing parents.  Sage lost his parents in the same fashion.

"Did you get bit by a wolf or a dog or anything recently?"

She shook her head again.  "No.  Why?"

"There are only two reasons why you'd be a werewolf."  I whispered so no one would hear.

Jo shouted, "I'm not a werewolf."  She covered her mouth and hung her head.

I chuckled and she hid even further.  "You are.  What you feel is my connection to the pack."

"You're not a werewolf."  She said.  "You are Venatori. I'm just a human."

I shook my head.  "My gut says you are wolf.  You were born a wolf, and you are nearing your change.  This moon or the next you'll change.  And I pray you aren't near anyone here when you do."

Lori giggled, "They lock us all in our rooms at night."

I nodded.  "I know.  But it's a dangerous time for a pup."

I patted Jo on the head knee and smiled.  "I'll get you help."

"Why can't you help me?"  She asked.

"I'll do my best, duckling."

She smiled at my term of endearment, "I don't think it works."

"Sure it does, duckling.  Just because you are a wolf doesn't change it."

Duke stood up and helped Cliff's sad form out the door as the bell tolled for our next activity to present itself.



# No Such Luck

The remainder of the day I tried to find Levi but no one knew where he was.  I couldn't get anything from the Archives while in the ward.  They frowned upon doing work and they frowned upon doing anything productive.  I was going to go fucking crazy.  After computer time we had an hour to our selves where everyone gathered in the common room.  It was annoying.  The only up side had been Jo sat in my lap.

Now if any other girl had sat in my lap without prompting I would have thought something was up.  But she was a wolf.  She was lost without her family.  I was pretty sure that whatever pack magic I had had taken hold of her and she was part of my pack.  Whatever that meant.  I didn't do anything.  But I hadn't done anything with Drake, or Matt either.  I just wanted to take care of them, and that was pretty much what was going on with Jo.  I don't even think she realized what she was doing.

Lori had giggled and sat next to us the next time we were in the common room.  We had arts and crafts after lunch.  I got another of those stupid pills.  I needed a goddamned computer and my anxiety was shooting through the roof.  To which Jo promptly came to sit in my lap again to comfort me.

No Levi.  No reseach.  No phone calls.  I was looking forward to bed.  Maybe I'd get to see Dev.  I liked that thought, it kept me going through the rest of the pointless day.  I needed to do something and by the time we were sent to our rooms for the remainder of the day I was bouncing off the walls with anxiety.  Yoga didn't help.  I did pull ups and push ups in every possible way I could think of before they called for lights out.

I wasn't even tired as I laid down to sleep.  The only thing I wanted to do was see my loves. All of them, but only one of them walked my dreams.  I could only hope he would tonight.



# Late Night Rendezvous

This was the first time I'd gone to sleep willingly wanting to fall asleep immediately. I wasn't tired, I was far from tired.  I was excited.  Excited to see Dev.  And that was just the possibility of it.  But I closed my eyes and pictured Dev lying next to me and the stars on my ceiling.  I counted them and thought of Dev as the darkness came.  My blue eyed boys were both curled around me in the darkness.  I could smell the citrus and lavender mixing together and they weren't even in the room.

I must have drifted because when I opened my eyes I was under the tree again - alone.  But I could smell citris and lavendar on the wind as it blew through the barren braches.  The images flickered like a television set needing rabbit ears adjusted.  Shifting and phasing in and out of existance.

I walked away from the tree towards the horizon.  It was perfect and yet so bizarre.  The sun and the stars, the moon and the clouds.  A path of green grass lead to the tree and all around it was green where before only brown overturned soil had been. There was a hand at the small of my back.  I smiled.  "I hoped you'd come."

Dev smiled.  "I can't stay long pretty boy.  But I could feel you calling me.  I've got to work in an hour."

"So I'll say what I need too before you go and then we can spend the rest of doing whatever."

Dev took my hands and pulled me against him sliding his hands around my waist, "Do whatever huh?"

I grinned and pressed a chaste kiss to his lips.  "Business first.  Did you ask Sage and Dorian what I told you last night?"

Dev nodded.  "Yeah.  I called both of them when I woke up. They weren't happy with me."

"Good.  I need help getting information.  Can you ask Sage or Dorian to come visit me?"  I asked Dev in a low whisper.

Dev chuckled.  "You can't ask him yourself?"

I sighed.  "I don't get phone calls.  I can't check my email.  I have to go through my therapist and I'd rather not tell Margo my theories right now."

"I'll ask him."  Dev sighed, "Time flows differently here.  I don't know how much time we have."

I pressed my lips to his and whispered against them.  "Then we shouldn't waste it talking anymore."

Dev laughed and pulled me down on top of him.  The world shifted around us we weren't outside.  I didn't know where we were but I didn't care as Dev pressed his body up against me.  His fingers gripped my hair as he pulled me closer to kiss harder and deeper.  I ground against him.  Dev groaned against me when there was a faint beeping in the distance.


I sighed.  "One day we'll get to finish this."

Dev grinned.  "One day pretty boy."  He kissed me hard and while we kissing the world shifted again and I was back in my room alone.  But the scent of lavendar and citrus lingered as I let myself drift into the darkness.



# Scars

I woke from sleep groggy and unsure where I was.  The sun was streaming through the window and there was a room wide buzzing going on.  I'd slept through my usual time.  I rubbed at my eyes wondering what time it was.  There had been dreams - dreams of Dev.  And Sage and Dee.  There had been dreams of the boys, of that mysterious tree.  I was sore as I got up out of the lumpy bed.  I missed my bed.  I'd be happy sleeping alone if I could just have my bed back.  I wanted to be back with Sage, but that wasn't going to happen.

There was a buzz and my door opened and a perky little nurse walked in with a smile.  "You have an early appointment."

"I need to change."  I said.

The little nurse nodded and closed the door and stood there waiting.  I shrugged to myself I had no problem getting naked in front of anyone.  She wasn't precisely the person I wanted to be naked in front of but whatever.  I didn't make a show of hiding myself, but I heard a small gasp as I pulled off my shirt and she saw the scars lining my back.  I heard her take a few steps then stopped a few feet from where I was changing.  She whispered, "You poor boy."

Such a pity party. Like I was showing you to get sympathy.  The little nurse closed the distance and put her hand on my back and I froze.  My heart raced and I could feel sweat beading on my forehead.  "Please don't." I managed to breathe out.

Her hand jerked from my back and I turned around pulling a pair of jeans on.  "I'd appreciate it if you didn't do that again."

She nodded.  "I'm sorry.  What happened?"

I shook my head, "It doesn't matter.  It's in the past."  I didn't want to talk about it with a stranger nor did I want to talk about it at all.  Now that I was fully dressed she lead me out of my room and to a different therapy room.  Great, this was just what I needed.

I sat down in the overfluffed couch and waited.

# Mr. Sétanta

The door opened and a man in a brown tweed suit and gray wisps of hair on his head stood in the doorway looking down through glasses perched on his hawk like nose.  "Mr. Sétanta?"

"Yes, but it's Nox."  I said.  I really hated being called that it reminded me I was still my mother's son.

"How are you today?"

"I'm fine."  The man sat down and in the uncomfortable chair across from me and settled down with his notepad and pen in hand as he flipped through a file which I presumed to be my record - Margo's notes.  "Where is Dr. Silverman?"

He looked up at met my eyes.  "We are both seeing you.  Dr. Eriksen wanted me to evaluate you."

"Why did my medical doctor want you a shrink to evaluate me?  The two aren't related are they?"  My mental and physical well being was not inquestion here I was here on suicide watch.

"Dr. Eriksen is concerned about your physical health pertaining to potential brain damage from the fall.  Asked me to evaluate you."

"How are you qualified to evaluate my mental state before and after if this is our first meeting?"

"I've read your files, Mr. Sétanta."

"It's Nox.  And my files are just words.  You can't evaluate someone based purely on words."

"Your notes clearly state you have an issue with change.  My being here is causing you anxiety and you are reacting just as I'd expect of you."  He sat up straight and looked at me through those spectacles with his dull gray eyes.  "I have been doing this longer than you've been a live boy.  Who are you to question my methods?"

I rolled my eyes.  "Fine.  Let's get this over with."

"Tell me what happened before you saw Mr. Spencer."

"I spent the night with my lovers.  I came in with Dorian to see Garrett, then the plan was to take all the boys home."  I said.  I left the part about my shields and maras out.  I was sure I'd be admitted for that type of talk.

"Your lovers?"

"Yes, my lovers.  As in I have more than one, and we all spent the night in the same bed."  I grinned at him, "And the fucking was amazing."  It was a complete lie since we hadn't had sex.  We had curled up together and slept, it was a means to an end.  And the man's reaction was priceless. He paled and blushed at the same time.  "I could go into details if you'd like.  What posistions worked for us.  Who did what to who."

He interreupted me.  "No."  He cleared his throat.  "That's alright.  Why was Mr. Vega at your home?"

"I didn't wake up on time and they were worried about me.  Dorian's like my father."

"Why were they worried, you're leaving something out."

I sighed.  "Alright, the truth.  Dev and Dee came over so Dev could help me rebuild my shields."

"Why would you need to do that, once they are built they should be easy enough to erect and take down."

"My shields was filled with black veins preventing it from closing completely."

"And how do you know this?"

I smiled.  "Because I saw it in a dream."  Which wasn't exacly a lie, just out of order.  "Sometimes my dreams reflect reality.  Dev is a telepath and he was able to help be tear down my wall.  Sage was there to protect me from the nightmares I usually have.  Dee was there to add the strength of her own shields to all of us to keep us safe from whatever had infected my shields."

"You think something infected you?"

"I know it.  Since I rebuilt my shields I've not had any nightmares.  My demon hasn't come to haunt me.  But it physically attacked my family.  It went after the boys who were downstairs sleeping.  Faelen changed in his fear and his protectiveness of his little brother.  It was only a partial change, but he did it none-the-less."

"You willingly live with a werewolf and a dragon."

I sighed.  "I willingly live with a werewolf, a dragon and a technopath.  I am half human, half Venatori.  Why should this even be a question?  Who I spend my time with is not a concern of yours."  I wanted to get up and leave I was tired of this questioning.  "My nightmares are spawned from the things Garrett Spencer did to me as a child.  He'd get inside my head.  He made me beleive he was hurting me.  And then after I left his care the dreams started.  Everynight for the past 17 years the same dream happens.  A darkness so thick you can't breath.  A fog rolls in.  A red light moves towards me.  When I was a boy I used to fight the demon.  Talk back.  Now I give in to what it wants.  It hurts less.  I submit willingly, remove my shirt.  Stand in position and wait for the first whip made of air or earth.  Fire or water.  Waiting for the whip to rain down on my back.  Screaming does no good.  Begging for mercy or asking it to stop only makes it worse.  I let it hit me.  And in the real world my body feels the same beating.  I wake up blood covered, my skin flayed on my back.  Every night for seventeen years."

The man stared back at me in disbeleif.  I stood up and turned around pulling the t-shirt over my head.  "This is what he did to me."  The wispy hair man gasped at the sight of my back.  "Garrett may not have done it personally, but he's the reason it happens."  I turned around and stared down at the man who was suppose to be unbiased.  "The man that tormented me night and day for most of my life was killed by a demon.  It walked off the ledge of the AU building and fled Garrett's body as he started the fall down.  I could have let him die without trying.  No one would have faulted me for letting him die.  I couldn't save him.  But the thing is.  I knew I could save him.  I knew there was a slight probability I could save him.  So I did.  I tried.  I ran over the edge and jumped without thinking.  I used my gift to slow us down.  I used it to soften the earth below us.  But the velocity was still too great.  I felt my bones shatter on impact and then there was nothing.  I tried to save him.  I needed to save him.  I don't care if he hurt me.  He was the victim in this act.  I couldn't catch his killer, there was no point in trying.  But I could try to save the man I hated."

I tugged my shirt on as the door buzzed open.  "We are done here."  I said as I opened the door and walked out while the shrink still stared at me openly.




# Screams

I was going to become the guy who stormed out of therapy sessions it seemed.  I didn't want to be around people.  I wanted to go home.  This place sucked.  I headed towards my room but got distracted when I heard a faint scream of terror.  I stopped in the middle of the hallway and waited for it to sound again.  But it didn't, I must have imagined it.

But the moment I started walking the scream became plain as day.  It wasn't loud but the sound made me though of terror - of nightmares come to life.  I closed my eyes and I focused on the sound.  I wasn't the best tracker by sound, but I could do it.  And when I got close enough I could smell the fear.  But for now sound was all I had.

I took a few steps forwad and my eyes still closed, letting my hearing guide me.  Super human hearing had it's benefits.  No one ever snuck up on me unless they knew how to be extremely quiet.  But here every sound was distinct.  I heard a pen drop in the common room and the rustle of the persons clothes as they picked it up.

I could hear faint monitor beeping in some of the nearby rooms.  They had machines hooked up to patients, but that wasn't where I was heading.  I could hear snores from down the hall of someone catching a nap in a closet.  I should say something, but maybe I'd need leverage one day.  Though I wouldn't know who to blackmail if needed as I didn't go see.

I followed the faint screams and it grew louder.  I could smell the fear in the air and wondered why no one bothered to check on the boy inside.  I knew who it was before I got to the door.  It was locked from the outside and there was no way in.  But I needed to get inside.  The boy was afraid.  I could feel his fear.  It was thick in the air.  I shivered in the warm air.  His fear was that strong.

My ability didn't work with eletronic locks.  But I knew who's would.  I sighed and turned around to find my way back to my room.  Dev had worked last night, he might be home asleep or there soon.  Could I take a nap during the day?  I might if this boring routine kept up like this.

# The Dream Tree

My room was empty.  The bed was lumpy and I truly missed Sage.  And Dev.  Fuck that man was becoming ingrained in my life as much as Sage had.  Why?  I kept asking myself.  This was Sage's thing.  He wanted more.  Needed more.  I didn't.  I just needed Sage, yet Dev - there was just something about him.  I was drawn to him and he was drawn to me.

And then there was Dee.  I didn't even know her.  Sage liked her.  She was Dev's live in girlfriend - had been for years.  So why was Dev taking up my brain?

I didn't want to overthink things.  Sage wanted to watch.  I needed to be available for that.  But yet I knew Dev was becoming more than just someone who we had sex with.  I needed to talk to Sage.

I lay down in my bed and I tried to sleep.  But it wasn't working.  Even thinking of Dev was making things worse.  Our last dream together had been cut short last night.  My body was still aching from the excitement.  I wanted more.  More Dev.  More sex.  Fuck I hadn't had sex in over two weeks.  Granted I didn't care during those two weeks but fuck!  And now I was in some mental facility taking fucking medication that was trying to kill me - or at least that's what my brain kept saying.  Twice a day that little blue pill was given to me.  And twice a day it felt like I was suffocating for a few minor seconds and then it was gone, like it never happened.

I blinked and in that moment I must have drifted to sleep.  I saw the tree standing before me in that bizzare landscape.  The sun and the stars still shining together against the autumn backdrop of trees.  Yet my tree was barren.  I ran my fingers over the rough bark and smiled.  The eyes were closed and it looked peiceful.  Those eyes ... And that's when memories flooded into my brain and my eyes shot open.

I sat up and looked at the desk on the far wall.  My notebook was there spiral free but all together.  Dorian was a wonderful man, I could kiss him.  I wouldn't because people would talk, but the sentiment was there.  I flipped to the last page of the notebook where I always drew the one image that always seemed to call to me.  The tree stood in the middle of the page. There were no stars or sun in the background but I could see the images in my head clear as day.  The three eyes in a triangle.  Three loves of my life.  Each looking back at me.

Another memory drifted forward eyes around me.  Images floating through the haze of the drugs I was given.  I had always thought it strange that the blue eyes were different colored.  I always thought they were symbolic of something and now I knew.  Fuck!  I hated prophecy and fate and destiny.  I wasn't meant for this.  If I was meant for this it meant some higer fucking being beleived I needed to be tortured.

I could feel the fire heating the air around me in my anger.  I brought it all together and let it out therough my upturned hand.  A jet of fire went up towards the ceiling stopped by a dome of air.  The fire curled around and the room grew hot.  I took a deep breath and focused on the flames, on venting my anger through the inferno.  I needed to get out of her.  I was going to go crazy in this place.

# Crisis

I didn't really hear someone came in on a higher level, but when the cold hand touched my arm I jumped.  But I had heard them gasp and come in.  I had changed the pattern around me to avoid anyone else.  I heard a soft voice but the blood rushing through my ears and the fury in my blood was still making it hard to hear.  The fire popped out of existance with a low whine.

"Nox..." a soft voice said as I came back to the real world.  "You okay?"

I looked down at the hand on my arm and then up at the face attached to the arm and frowned.  My purpled haired first was looking back at me like she cared what happened to me.  My inability to answer prompted her to pull me towards the chair.  "Sit down."  She started fussing over my vitals and my eyes and I blinked at her.

"I'm fine.  I was just upset."

"You don't ever lose control."  She said as she continued to fuss over me.

"I didn't lose control.  I just got lost in it - on purpose."

"What's wrong?  Why?"  She asked as she knelt down in front of me looking up at me with a pair of purple tinted eyes I knew were blue.  What was it with blue eyes I found so attractive?   Where those visions why?

I sighed and shook my head.  "I felt played with, is all."

"Who would be stupid enough to play with you?  I mean other than Aaron and his goons."  She smiled up at me.

"The universe, fate, destiny, god.  You tell me."

Madison nodded.  "An excisential crisis?  I'm not qualified to help with that.  Maybe you should talk to your therapist about that."

I glared at her and Madison laughed, "Oh,kay then maybe not.  You sure you are alright, that fire was hot?"

I nodded.  "I'm fine."

She stood up and pressed her hand to my forehead.  "Alright.  You have visitors.  If you'd like they can come back here or you can visit with them in another room."

"Here is fine."  I said.

Madison smiled, "Okay.  I'll go get them."

# Visitors

I leaned back against the chair and let my head fall backwards.  I ached.  My body still was still repairing itself it seemed and I had expended a great deal of energy in the fires.

There was a knock on the door and Madison was outside, "He's in here.  We'll have someone bring his lunch down so you can have as much time as you'd like to spend with him."  I looked up and saw not one but both of my blue-eyed boys and I grinned at their appearance.  Madison laughed.  "He hasn't smiled like that since he got here.  I'll leave you guys two it."

Dev stood in the door way and watched Madison walk down the hall.  "She's cute."

I nodded. "Uh huh."  I made sure to think of the first time I'd see Madison and what we did.

Dev's head snapped back in my direction with a smirk.  "Damn it, pretty boy!  You have to stop doing that."

Sage looked at Dev then back at me.  I shrugged and Dev chuckled, "He was thinking about his first time with Madison."

Sage turned a pretty pink color as he asked, "You've slept with her?"

"She was my first."

"Your first ever?"  Sage asked.

I nodded.  "Yeah.  We had a crush on the same guy.  She came up to watch him at swim practice while I was taking care of things and she took pity on me and we had sex on the floor of the empty classroom."

Dev was shutting the door behind him as he stepped inside.  Sage looked at him, "And you saw that?"

"No, but he was thinking about it.  That was more details that I gathered."  Dev explained.

Sage frowned, "You don't see things in my head like that do you?"

Dev turned Sage to face him and pulled him against the front of his body and pressed a kiss to his lips.  I got a front row seat to Dev and Sage kissing and a small groan slipped from my lips.  I ached for so many other reasons in that moment.   Dev whispered against Sage's lips when they parted, "I don't pry, deadshot.  I promise you unless you want me to I won't dig.  But I do hear what you are thinking.  I can't help it, it's like a connection is built between us and you share thoughts with me.  You block your's well.  Pretty boy doesn't.  He kinda just falls out."

Sage laughed.  "He does that with his voice too.  On and on and on about what he feels.  He'll make some girl happy one day.  Sometimes I think he just needs to shut up and man up about it."

I stuck my tongue out at Sage and he raised his eyebrow.  "What did I say about that?"

"I don't know lover, what did you say?"  Sage took a few steps towards me and I grinned at him.  "My body hurts.  Be nice."

"Are you saying no?"  Sage asked.

I shook my head.  "Never.  Just be gentle."

Sage laughed.  "I can be that."  He sighed and so did Dev.  "But we came for another reason."

I sank deeper into my chair if that was even possible.  I so wanted to just curely up with my boys.  All of them really.  "Where's Dee?"

Dev frowned, "She had to pick up a double.  She hasn't been home at all lately.  After spending the time here with you when she could, we've all been picking up extra time."

I sighed.  "I'm sorry."

Sage punched my shoulder, "You should be."

"Ow."  I said rubbing my arm.  "That's not gentle."

Sage grinned down at me and then leaned over and kissed me.  He tasted like coffee which meant he'd been working a lot too.  I hummed against his lips. I wanted so much more but I put my hands on the edge of my chair and gripped tightly, I'm sure they turned white from the tight grasp.

"Sorry Nox."  Sage said as he helped me stand up by my elbow.  He directed me to the middle of the lumpy bed and sat down on one side of me and Dev sat on the other side. I leaned back so my head rested against the wall my blue eyed boys turned so that they could see me.  "We have some things to talk about..."

# A Long Talk

The look on my face or the thoughts running through my head must have queued Dev into something.  His smirk changed from it's normal curve to a frown as he grabbed my t-shirt and pulled me towards him.  "It's not one of those talks pretty boy."

He leaned down and pressed his lips to mine.  I felt Sage's hand on my leg and I wished he'd move it higher.  But Dev moved away and smiled at me.  "Just heavy stuff."

Sage chuckled.  "Real heavy."  He patted my leg and left it there.  The warmth pooled in my body and I groaned as I straighted my body back from Dev's manhandling.  "Dev said you wanted me to look into a Levi and Amelia."

I frowned at the memory of Amelia and the description Cliff gave me of what remained of her body.  Dev sighed.  "I'm sorry Nox."

"I didn't know her."

Sage interrupted.  "I know you didn't know her she's been dead a good twenty years."

Dev sighed, "We saw her last night.  Sage showed me a picture earlier.  Dead on."

"She's covered in black vines according to Cliff." I said.  I shivered and Dev's hand touched my cheek and he ran his fingers down my cheek and over my jaw line.

Sage chuckled.  "He looks at you like he's a puppy in love."

Dev laughed.  "I think he is and it's killing him inside."  He looked at Sage with a grin.  "He's in knots."

"I'm sitting right here."  I said but Sage and Dev were looking at each other, Dev's hand was holding Sage's hand against my knee.  They were having a conversation in Sage's head that I wasn't privy too.  I pulled myself from between them up into the corner of my bed.  I didn't want to know what they were talking about and I didn't want to be in the middle of it.  They were talking about me that much I knew.

Sage shook his head and seemed to be shaking the cobwebs out when he saw me in the corner of my bed with my pillow in my lap and my body shaking.  He squeezed Dev's hand and Dev looked at me.  He looked like he wanted to say something but he didn't just looked at me and stood up.  "Tell him about Levi."

Sage stood up and moved away from Dev and me.  "Levi is a in the infirmary he's insane.  But I don't have much more than that."
Dev smiled.  "But Dorian has more."

Sage nodded.  "Levi was a student of Garrett's.  A few years after you.  He said he was promising student.  Like you.  His words exactly."

The information was good.  I beleived it.  I knew I had to move.  I knew I had to get up but there was a personal problem holding me here.  Sage and Dev had a conversation about me.   And I don't think it was a good thing.  I crawled out of my corner and left my room with my boys still standing there staring at each other.  Fuck!

# Hallway Bantaer

I didn't have time to deal with whatever they were having problems with.  I walked down the hall towards where I knew Levi was.  I could hear people in room as I past them.  I felt the fear and smelt it as I went.  It got stronger the closer I got the the boy's room.  I looked at the locking mechanism and frowned.

I hadn't really been paying attention but now that I'd stopped I smelt jasmine and lavender mixed in the fear.  Sage stepped around me and pulled out his phone and a few gadgets he had in his coat pocket.  A touch to the small of my back made me freeze and Dev pressed his lips to my cheek, "It's okay pretty boy."

Sage was busy.  Dev's hand was at my back I could think the thought and have a private conversation like they did but I whispered instead.  "What was that about?"

Dev frowned and pressed another kiss to my cheek.  "That's between you and Sage."

I pulled away from Dev.  "The conversation was between the two of you."

Sage sighed.  "Tell him."  He continued to work on the lock.

"Sage wanted more.  Our conversation was about tonight."

"What about tonight?"

I saw a grin on Sage's lips and Dev started signing softly in my ear.  "Stars shining bright above you / Night breezes seem to whisper "I love you" / Birds singin' in the sycamore trees / Dream a little dream of me."  With each verse Dev pulled a reaction from my body.  If they ever got me alone in a room where there were no boundaries, I'd be putty in their hands.  Fuck!

I grinned, "You want me to dream of you tonight?"

Sage chuckled.  "Yes.  That's what he's asking."

Dev grinned, "We are going to try something."

The door clicked open and Sage turned to me and stepped closer.  "Nox.  We can make this work."

I smiled.  "I missed you."  I pressed my lips to his.  When I pulled away I grabbed Dev's shirt and pulled him close.  "You too.  I missed you."

Dev pulled away first and nodded towards the door, "Let's see the boy."

# Forging Bonds

We went into the room. I  didn't even ask Sage how he'd done what he did.  I wouldn't have understood anyway.  There was a large lump in the bed hands and feet were strapped to the sides.  It looked like torture.  The figure was sleeping but you could see him struggling against his bonds.  Dev gasped and almost collapsed to the ground but Sage was there and caught him.  They both sank to the ground.  Dev's voice was distant and weak, "Fuck me."

I was torn between going to Dev and trying to help Levi.  I needed Dev to help the boy so he won out.  I was down next to Dev.  He was pale and his blue eyes were fading fast.  I ran my fingers over his jawline and smiled at him.  "How can we help?"

There as a simple thought in my head.  It wasn't mine but it wasn't words either just a vague image of how we could help.  How I could help.  Sage held Dev, cradled him in his long arms and when I stood up I smiled down at them.  My two blue eyed loves.  Fuck I'd fallen fast.  I was so screwed.

But I didn't have time to deal with my problems.  I had a boy who was overpowering my rockstar with fear.  I'd done it before.  Taken a kid under my protection.  And that was what Dev wanted me to do.  I pulled at the pack magic inside of me.  I could feel it hum in my head and Sage gasped behind me as I pulled the magic around me.  I stole a glance at him and his head was bowed, his body protectively covering Dev but he had submitted to the power.  Shit!

I needed to understand this better - but another problem for later.  I wrapped that power around the boy.  I called his name and felt the pack protect him.  I could feel the fear radiating down the vine inside of us.  The thing that bound us all together, a living breathing rope.  It was pack.  It was nature.  It was one with the world.

The power floated around me, through me.  How did this work?  There were voices but I couldn't make them out.  I didn't understand them.  I sighed.

There was a hand at the small of my back and then another was around me from the other side.  I felt more than knew Dev was using his power.  I could feel him through the bond, he was looking around Levi's dreams.  He was awake and standing and I was confused.  Dream walkers didn't need to be asleep to walk that plane.  Garrett never had been.  I gasped and Sage squeezed my hip.  He was there.  I could feel his power flickering around us.  I really didn't know what was going on.  Dev sent reassuring mental images.  He was tired, and growing more so with each passing second.  I wrapped my arms around him and I felt him sink into me - physcially and mentally.  Sage grew closer, it was like we were one.

Fuck!  The singular word echoed through us.  I don't know who said it or if we all did.

And as quickly as the moment had come the power collapsed leaving the three of us leaning against the others for support.

# Levi's Not Here

Dev and Sage sat down on the floor whatever energy they had expended had exhausted them.  I stood over Levi's bed and sent the elements through his body.  He had fallen still after we'd done what we did - whatever it was.  His face was relaxed.   The rhythm of his breathing was that of sleep.  I undid his restraints and helped his body heal from the wounds.

At that moment a rash of people flooded into the room.  "What are you doing here?"  Someone asked.  Dev and Sage were standing beside me in the next moment.

A burly orderly walked in and frowned at me.  "I knew you'd be trouble."

I grinned at him.  "I was just helping him.  I knew how.  I'm sorry."

One of the doctors came in and looked over at the boy.  "Why did you unrestrain him?"

"He doesn't need it anymore." I said.

The boy groaned and everyone in the room darted out except the doctor and us.  I looked at Dev and he smiled and took Sage's hand.  He'd heard my thought, 'get out just in case'

Sage looked back at me and I smiled at him with reassurance. "I'll be fine. Help Dev."

My boys left and I looked down at the boy.  He stared up at me and blinked.  And then there was nothing in his eyes.  Where a moment of recognition had been, there was nothing now.  The boy was not there.

The doctor was checking his vitals.  He kept looking at his pupils.  "We need to do some scans.  But whatever you did, he's not in pain anymore.  I don't think he'll ever be the way he was."  The doctor said.

The man looked at me and frowned.  "Thank you, but you should go now."

I nodded.  "You care for him don't you."

The man nodded.  "He's been under my care for 11 years."

I sighed.  "He came in when he was six?  Has he always been in bed?"

The doctor shook his head, "No.  He only got bad here recently.  A few weeks ago he fell into a coma.  It's not the first time he has but this one was by far the worse.  Whatever happens to him makes his condition worse."

"Can I ask what you think is wrong with him?"

"They boy was abused as a child.  He hurts himself, and his mind has never been right.  Claims to see things that aren't there.  He hears voices."

"I know I'm asking too much, but what does he see, what does he hear?"

The doctor frowned, "I'm sorry I can't tell you.  All I can say is none of it was real."

I doubted that very highly.  Everything he'd seen was real.  I beleived him even if he couldn't tell me.

The doctor escorted me out of the room and closed the door.  "I don't know how you got in there without a key but don't do it again."

I grinned at him and watched him leave.  Dev and Sage were sitting against the wall. I sat down next to Dev and pput my hand on his.  "So we are dreaming tonight, the three of us?"

Dev grinned, "We'll see if I can.  I am going to have to call in sick I think.  My fucking body hurts."

Sage smiled.  "I'll take you to my house, so you can sleep.  Drake and Fae can stay with Kai.  Dee can come by too."

Dev nodded.  "We'll see you later pretty boy?"

"In our dreams."  I grinned at him and leaned over to press a kiss to his lips.   I helped them both up and kissed Sage good-bye too.  I'd see my boys later... shit my life was getting more complicated each day.



# Push and Pull

Sage took Dev home.  Night couldn't come fast enough.  But the thought that the three of them were alone again together made me cringe.  I knew I would be there with them, that it wasn't their fault I was locked up in here.  I had done it willingly and knowningly because I knew the Venatori.  But they spent their lives together.  I was stuck in this shit hole.

Lunch came and went.  Dinner too.  Those little blue pills still taking my breathe away.  It'd be nice if they actually did something, but I didn't feel any less depressed, any less anxious.  Other than that shortness of breath for a moment or two there was nothing.  Jo was neither at lunch or breakfast and that had me a tad concerned but when I asked Lori I was dismissed it with a change of topic.

I didn't know where her room was, and while I could sense her off in some direction I let it be. And I really wasn't thinking beyond the cursory notice she wasn't here.  My mind was firmly planted on my two blue eyed babes I was going to dream about tonight.

My little group noticed my distraction and left me to my idle thoughts.  I went to bed early and didn't do yoga or anything like I usually did.  My mind was still feeling the effects of whatever magic we'd done before.  I felt them yet I knew that was wrong.  I felt them like I felt Ant.  That distant link we shared from a the blood sharing.  I could easily call Ant to me and he could whisk me away to some tropical island and no one would know where I'd gone.  But the shadows in my room were too small and I really hated traveling that way.  And I didn't want to go anywhere but home.

Laying down in my bed I couldn't see the stars through any window or see the moon in the sky, but I felt that pull.  It wasn't on me, but Fae and Jo both felt it.  The full moon was close I should figure out how close in the morning.  My thoughts of stars and moons left and I drifted into the void of my dreams.

The comforting feel of floating in the darkness.  I'd never thought dreams could be peaceful.  And now, it seemed I was doing just that.  I felt the push and pull of my cusconsdious.  I went where it told me to.  I drifted in the images and thought of blue eyes.  One so dark they almost looked black in the right light, the other so light they were almost grey.  It was their eyes that drew me towards them in terms of attraction.  I'd never thought about it before and I really didn't have much time to think about it then as the world around me brightened.

# Lone Tree

I wondered why the darkness was there.  I guessed I never truly learned how to dream with my nightmares always present.  But the tree was mine and I stood staring at the barren bark from a distance.  A green patch lay at it's feet nestling the stone dragon in it's roots.  And two paths where Dev had walked.  He made the grass grow in my desolate imagry.

A soft breeze blew and I could smell lavender and jasmine mixed with Dev's citrus.  There was a light touch of rose mixed in and I stared in awe as the field where the lone tree stood turned green and then flowers bloomed and I could hear the sound of a nearby creek - the running water the only real sound in the area.  I looked around but I didn't see anyone.  Just me and the new plants.  The tree remained barren.  But everything else around it was lush and vibriant.  I wondered what it all meant when I heard the echo, "It means nothing pretty boy."

I looked around and sa Dev standing a few feet behind me with Sage.  Sage was looking around - this was his first time in my head and I was sure he expected something more.

Dev smiled at me, "It's hard bringing Sage through your shields.  We can't stay long."

I smiled at him, "That's okay.  I got to see you.  Dee spending the night?"

Sage nodded and said something, but I couldn't hear him.  Dev sighed, "Sage said, yes, Dee's here with us.  We all miss you.  Dev couldn't bring you."

"The communication must be through telepathy?"  I questioned but it wasn't meant for an answer.

Sage tugged at Dev's hand and they walked to the tree.  Sage's hand was crassing the bart and I felt a sharp shock.  The eyes on the trunk popped open and Sage fell backwards and winked out of existence.

Dev smiled at me.  "He's alright.  I can't hold him here.  We have to practice this.  But I think it's doable.  If we all learn, and maybe if you are with us."

"Defeats the purpose if I'm with you." I whined.

Dev held out his hand and I took it.  He drew me close and pressed his lips to mine as he put his other hand on my hip and pulled us even closer together.  We kissed long and hard before I heard a blaring sound.  Dev looked around, "That's on your side pretty boy."

I sighed.  "Tell Sage I'm sorry I didn't get to kiss him too.  Will you kiss them both for me."

Dev chuckled, "My pleasure, pretty boy."  Dev waved and then was gone.  I was alone in my newly light place.  It didn't fade with their departure and the grass stayed green, the blossoms wilted only a little as if the sun had faded just a little and they were sad.  They were sad - I was sad.

The sound echoed again through my eyes and I willed myself awake.  It wasn't hard, I'd I'd done it so many times before.

# Werewolf Attack

My eyes opened slowly as my head pounded from the alarms going off.  The doors were locked and all I heard was the screaching of the siren.  My head hurt.  I missed Sage and Dev and now I was in the middle of a situation I didn't find tenable.  I didn't want to be locked up while... I listened to the siren going off, all sirens in the building told us what was happening if you understood the sirens.

I was in the middle of a werewolf attack.  And it was here where I was and I was fucking locked up instead of where I could do the most good - out there stopping it.  I knew it was Jo.  I knew I could calm her.  I don't know how I knew, but I knew.  I helped Dom and Adrian before hunt down a loose pup who had problems changing.  I knew I could do it if I could only get to her.  But I couldn't.

I stood by the door trying to see out the tiny window in its metal structure.  I could melt the door, or blow it down but that was distructive.  I pressed the intercom and the response was almost immediate.  "You need to stay in  your room where it's safe."

I pressed the button again.  "I'm a fucking hunter, unless you have hunters outside this room right now, let me out.  I can help and I can prevent anymore damage and anyone else from getting hurt."

I couldn't tell what was going on, on the other side of the intercom I heard nothing.  No static, just nothing.  My room was devoid of all sound save my breathing.  I pressed the button again.  "If you don't unlock my door I will melt the hinges and fry the electronics and then you'll have to fix it."

There was a short blip on the intercom and then nothing.  Moments later the door buzzed open and I turned the handle to let myself out.

I opened my self to the world around me.  I touched my pack connection.  I was finding it easier than I had weeks before and months before that.  Hell I hadn't beleived I was back until I met Sage.  Now?  Now I relied on it.

I followed the pull to 'kin'.  She wasn't my kin.  We were nothing alike but she was mine.  And I was hers.  I knew that.  I felt that.

Down the hall I found a very large hulking shadow cornering Sam the orderly.  I reached out with pack magic as I approached her.  "Jo.  Stop.  Sam is a good man."

The glowing amber eyes turned in my direction and I let all my power flow out.  She cowed before me and I looked at Sam.  "You can go now, Sam.  Just go slow."  The man nodded his head and moved slowly along the wall away from the large wolf who had him cornered.

I kept her attention with the outflux of power.  Her eyes were lowered, and her body bowed as she kept her guard up.  She was lower than me, but she was wary.  I didn't blame her.  Some alphas were mean when you misbehaved.  Some would kill you.  But none here in New York.

I kept my pace slow and I knew that a crowd was forming behind me.  I threw a wall of air behind me and off to the sides cooridors so I was essentially trapped in a corner with a first time werewolf who hadn't had the proper guidance.  Nothing about Jo spoke werewolf.  I wondered how she'd fallen through the cracks - been allowed to be corraled here in the Infirmary of the Venatori.  Wolves didn't do this, and especially not New York wolves.  I wondered where she was from.

But I couldn't ask now.  And I had more pressing matters to attend to as I finally was with in touching distance of Jo's werewolf form.  I slowly reached out and her head lowered away from me until she was lying flat on the ground.  The power cowing her even further.  I touched her soft gray fur and she froze beneath my fingers.  I sent the pack magic through her and willed her to change.

Her form shifted.  It looked painful and I heard gasps from behind the air walls.  No one had actually seen a wolf shift before.  No one cared to understand.  This wasn't my first and it wasn't likely my last.  Not with a wolf born boy living in my home - Sage's home.  We needed to start his education. I would need to speak with Adrian and Dom about that.  I may be his alpha but I was no wolf.

Jo's body collapsed against the cold tiles and I dropped the walls of air and the nurses came rushing down.  "I think it's best if I stay with her tonight."

One of the nurses nodded but the others protested how it was not safe.  Sam said from behind them.  "I don't think you need to worry about him."  He came up to me and offered me his hand.  "Thank you, Nox.  I'm grateful you were here."

I smiled.  "No problem."

I carried Jo to my room and laid her on my bed and Sam brought her a change of clothes for later.  For now we'd leave her naked under a blanket just in case she shifted again.  And for now we waited for daylight.  And I wasn't going to get anymore sleep.
