# The Orange Door

I paced outside the orange door in the lower Academy levels. My shirt ironically matched the color almost perfectly, but you could only see the v of it beneath the gray hoodie I had zipped almost all the way. My hair and nails matched my shirt today. I was trying not to be nervous, but my hands were sweating and my heart was racing. I wasn't sure I could do this, I had almost left several times, but I had to do this. No matter what it cost me. I had to do this.

The door opened and I froze facing the door and the man standing staring at me with his dirty brown eyes and that slimy smile. His smile only slide a fraction when he saw me. I tried to breath. I clenched my fist, digging my fingernails into the palm of my hand and I was sure I would see blood if I were to look at them now. "Nox, my boy." His voice was just as I remembered it. The only difference between when I was a boy and now was his hair had a touch of gray in it.

"I'm not your boy." I spit out. I was surprised at my own venom in my voice and I took a step back excepting him to lash out at me.

He only laughed at me. The sound grated on my ears and I shivered. "You will always be my boy. What can I do for you, my boy?" Garrett chuckled as he emphasized the last part of his sentence.

I wasn't sure how I managed to spit it out but I did. "I'm here to see Sam. Not you."

Garrett frowned. "Are you poaching my students?" He took a step towards me and I took a step back.

I shook my head. "I just want to talk to him."

Garrett snickered at my reaction. "Does his father know you are here?"

I shrugged. "I told him I would talk to him."

"I heard you and he had a falling out." Garret smiled a little too knowingly, like he knew what was going on, but then he didn't really. How could he? Or maybe he did know? The thing had said I was getting too close. Too close to what I'd thought then, was this that thing?

Garrett's smirk told me nothing. "He's a very good student, much like you were I think. He's collecting his things." Garrett pushed the orange door open and a small boy who looked like Dylan did when he was that age. Or would have if I'd known him then. Garrett waved a farewell to Sam, "Nox here will make sure you make your next class."

I muttered "Thank you," to Garrett as he left us alone in the room that I disliked.


# Meeting Sam

The boy looked startled when Garrett spoke to him. If his training was anything like mine, the boy was lost inside his head trying to come back to the reality of things. Seeing what was truly real.

He looked up at me with wide brown eyes and I saw a tear slide down his cheek. I knelt down in front of him and wiped it away with the pad of my thumb. "Hi, Sam." I said in a soft quiet voice.

He gave me a shy smile. "I'm Nox." I held out my hand to shake hands and he took it in his hand with care and gave my hand a small squeeze before he let go of my hand. "I thought you had passed fire-started training."

Sam chocked on his words, "Me. too."

"Did Garrett pull you out of class?" I asked.

He shook his head, "No. My teacher sent me here. Said I had to do go one more time. Emma too, she was after me." He pointed down the hall. "She's down the hall waiting for... him."

The fear in his voice was not lost on me as he spoke of Garrett. I smiled at him. "Did he hurt you?"

Sam shook his head. But I could see the lie within his eyes. I gave him a smile to reassure him and asked as I tapped his head, "Did he hurt you inside here?"

The boy's eyes went wide. He scrambled away from me knocking over the chair. "It's not real. My mom and dad said so."

I stayed where I was and asked, "What isn't real, Sam?"

"The dreams. They aren't real. I'm imagining them, it's just in my head. You are in my head. I didn't tell my mom and dad I saw Emma. Or you." He gasped and whispered, "Or the others..." His words trailed off and he fell to the floor and wrapped his arms around his legs and started rocking back and forth.

I crawled to the boy and sat in front of him. "I'm real. Emma is real. I think they all are real." I held out my hand and touched his knee and he jumped. "See I'm real." I turned my hand palm up and wiggled my fingers begging him to take them without asking. "I'll tell you a secret."

He looked up at me tears shining in his eyes. "I have the same dreams. I've had similar ones since I was your age." I turned around on the floor and pulled my shirt and hoodie up over my head and I heard the boy gasp. Cold fingers touched my back and I froze. The prior fear from before increased tenfold and I could hear my ragged breath and my heart in my chest almost hurt it was pounding so hard.

There was movement behind me and the cold fingers on my hand taking my shirt and hoodie from my fingers and letting them fall back down over my back. The small arms of the boy wrapped around my neck from behind and he pressed his face into my neck. I felt him crying more than I heard him and I reached around and pulled him into my lap, his arms still around my neck and I held him while he cried. I whispered through my dissipating fear, "I believe everything."


# Finding Emma

We sat wrapped around each other for a long time.  No one bothered us here.  We'd only be kicked out if there was a scheduled lesson.  Sam stopped crying and I hugged him tight before I held him away from me.  "Can you take me to Emma?  We need to stop this."
 
Sam nodded and stood up and took my hand.  "This way."
 
I stood up and pulled my shirt and hoodie down and followed Sam through the halls of the Academy to another orange door and I tried not to let my fear of what we'd find.  The rooms were sound proof but you didn't hear any sounds coming in.  We went up stairs to the observation room and saw Emma with her hands pressed to the wall and Sam gasped and I felt my heart jump into my throat.  Garrett was standing behind her whispering in her ear.  Sam's hand tightened around my hand.  He pulled himself closer.  Fury rose up inside and I touched the intercom button.  "Open the door Garret."  I was a lot braver when I was this far away from him.  I didn't know if it's would last, but I wasn't going to let him hurt that little girl anymore.
 
He looked up into the observation room looking for me, but he couldn't see, he knew better. I touched few more buttons on the panel with the intercom and then I went down stairs and I pounded on the door.  Garrett opened the door and had tentacle of air behind him like he did in my nightmares.
 
Sam hid behind my leg and held onto me whimpering.  I glared back at the man.  "You won't hurt them anymore."
 
Garrett laughed. "You think you have a backbone now?"
 
The air whip cracked in the air and I stood my ground.  "You will not hurt them again!"
 
A second and third whip joined the first and they all began cracking in the air like thunder.  Sam was crying behind me, clawing at my leg and it spurred me on.  I was waiting for him to hit me.  If he'd just hit me I'd be in my right to fight back.
 
Garrett laughed at me and he turned towards the little girl who was standing oblivious to what was happening around her, she was lost in the dream of her mentor.  The same dream Sam and I knew well.  He let one of the air whips crack against her skin.  She screamed silently still lost in the dream state but the pain was real. But the blood and the laceration on the girl's skin were real and that was more than enough for me.  I flung an net of air at Garrett and he flew to the wall behind me.  I spoke softly to Sam.  "Wake Emma, Sam.  Wake her and go upstairs and do not open the door for anyone but me.  Do you understand?"
 
Sam nodded his head and he went Emma and shook her and shook her until she came out of the daze crying.  Her body was already healing but I wrapped her in the elements as they left and hoped it wouldn't scar.  "Shut the door behind you."
 
Sam and Emma hurried out and the door closed behind them.


# I’m Better Than You
I stalked over to Garrett and for the first time in my entire life I didn't feel like I was five in his presence.  I felt like the man I had become because of him.  Because of the things he did to me.  I wasn't weak.  I wasn't a doormat.  I wasn't some fucking toy.  I stopped a foot from the man who I despised with every fiber of my being.  
 
And for the first time in his entire life Garrett stared back at me with fear.  I took a deep breath and had to take a step back.  My anger was racing around me, I could see fire spinning waiting to be unleashed.  I felt the heat of the room rising.  I took another step back and focused on the connections around me.  I thought about Drake and how he would never have a person like this in his life.  I wouldn't let anyone hurt Faelen ever again.  I would help Matt discover his true talent.  But most of all I focused on all those I loved.  I had people in my life. 
 
I sneered at Garrett.  "You won't take them from me."
 
I took a step back and released Garrett from the net of air and he fell to the floor in heap.  "I recorded your attack on me.  I recorded the fear Sam has for you.  But more importantly I recorded you hurting that little girl.  You will never touch another kid again.  If I find you near any child I will put a bullet in your brain faster than you can say my name.  And it is with in my right as Venatori to take the life of someone who harms his own by the Clandestine Providence.  You do not fucking hurt children!"
 
I turned around and walked quickly out the room and left the orange door wide open as I turned and went up into the observation room and knocked on the door.  "Sam let me in."
 
The door quickly unlatched and two sets of arms wrapped around me and I sank to the ground and pulled them both into my arms.  "He won't touch you again."  They cried and I cried with them.  "No one was going to hurt them again.  I would make sure of it."


# Protection
At the bottom of the stairs we heard Garrett open the door and when I looked down he was staring up at the three of us.  But he huffed and turned back down the hall and I assumed to security to see about getting the recording.  I stood up with the kids in my arms and let them find their feet.  "I have to get that recording."
 
The let me move but as soon as I was standing in front of the console they were attached to me again.  I worked as quickly as I could and saved the file of the camera to my phone which I then sent to Sage with a message.  "Keep this safe for me, love.  I'll explain in a bit."
 
He sent me a quick reply, "Got it."
 
I put my phone away and knelt down between the two kids and smiled at them.  I knew how to shield myself from a lot of things.  We could protect ourselves from mental intrusion by paths.  I don't know why I never thought of trying it with Garrett, maybe because I didn't realize he was still in my head. But these kids hadn't learned how to shield anything.  I knew pack magic could protect from some things, but I wasn't pack.  But Adrian insisted I was.  So I focused on that one truth, the hope that I could protect these kids from themselves.  I pulled on that invisible connection, the pack bond.  And I felt Sage, I heard him gasp in my head.  I felt Drake.  I blinked when I felt Matt there too... When the fuck did I did I do that?  Faelen was there too.  I couldn't see them, but I felt them.  I could sense them.  And at a distance I felt others but I didn't know what that meant.
 
I extended that connection to the kids I wrapped them in that sense of safety that was the pack.  The home, the forest, safe.  Family.  Pack!  They both relaxed in my arms and I felt them next to me both physically and mentally.  I don't know what it all meant, but if it kept them safe then I would take it.
 
I needed to talk to Adrian.  Or maybe Darwynn when he got back.  I kissed each of them on the head.  "I think you'll be safe now.  But you tell me if you aren't okay?"
 
They both nodded and I carried them down stairs and to their families.  I wanted to have a chat with them.


# Sam’s Mom

Sam's head was on my shoulder, Emma was just staring in behind us.  She was trembling with fear, I could feel her fear.  I muttered again, "He won't hurt you again.  And if he does I will take care of it."
 
Emma put her head on my shoulder and relaxed a little bit but we had made it to Sam's mother's place.  I didn't know if either would be home, but Sam seemed to think they would be.  I let him down when he squirmed and he produced a key and unlocked the door knocking before he did then turned the know and opened it.
 
A slight woman looked up from the couch she smiled at Sam and then frowned at me.  She got up and rushed over to us.  "Oh my god what happened?"  She was taking Emma from me but Emma clung tighter.
 
I held Emma to me.  "I don't think she will go with anyone but her parents right now.  They've been through a lot this past year.  And I think it's all over.  Can you call her parents?  And Dylan?  I need to talk to all of you."
 
She looked up and me and glared.  "And who are you?"
 
"It doesn't matter who I am, can you please call them?  It's important."  I asked again with a little more impatience.
 
She stepped away and made the call.  I heard her side of the conversation.  "Dylan, someone is here with Sam and Emma.  He wants to talk to their parents.  No, I don't know him.  Yes, tall, orange hair and nails and thick eyeliner, why? Should I be worried?"  The worry had started to increase in her voice I could only imagine what Dylan was saying on the other side of it, I could have tried to listen but it wasn't important.
 
She called Emma's parents and they said they'd be right over.  Emma clung to my neck but his mother finally took a look at Sam and she gasp and knelt down in front of him and took his face in her hands.  "Oh baby, did he hurt you?"
 
Sam nodded his head and that was all he could do before she was standing up and she was shoving me across the room.  "You don't have any right to hurt my kids."
 
I smirked a little and she slapped my face.  Sam took my hand and wrapped himself around my leg and yelled, "Not him!"
 
I smiled to disarm her and she glared at me.  "I will explain it all when everyone is here."
 
The door rushed opened and the door knob slammed into my back making me wince in pain and Dylan stopped short but he was inside the apartment soon followed by who I assumed were Emma's parents.  I didn't know them.


# Venatori Parents Suck

Dylan didn't bother apologizing he was walking around me and looking at Sam who was clinging to my hand.  I smiled at Emma's parents.  "My name is Nox Sétanta.  I've been dreaming about your children."
 
The women gasped apparently they knew of the dreams.  "We might want to sit down and talk."  I said
 
Emma's father took my hand. "Tim.  And this is my wife Darla.  What's this about?"
 
"You might want to sit down."  I said and waved my hand to the couch sitting across the room.  There were enough seats for the four of them to sit down comfortably so I sat on the floor so I wasn't imposing.  I was about to tell them that someone had been abusing the children, but I had no proof of it.
 
Both Emma and Sam sat with me much to their parents disapproval.  I took a deep breath to calm my fear and my anger.  Both were still making me jittery and I was glad to be sitting down.  "18 years ago I came to the Venatori because I sparked.  My teacher was Garrett Spencer.  And he has the ability to make me see things that aren't there - to feel things that aren't real.  When I graduated into regular classes he tried to hurt me again, and I sparked.  He said it was an accident, I suppose hoping it was another year I could spend with him.  But it wasn't an accident.  I knew what I was doing.  I lit him on fire on purpose because I wasn't going to let him hurt me again."
 
Sam clung to my arm and Emma was still wrapped around me and her hands squeezed tighter.  The both knew I said the truth, they had gone through it.  "But that next year I started having dreams, almost immediately after I stopped seeing Garrett.  I saw the same things he did to me in my head, except now I was hurting myself with my own ability.  I can open my psychiatric records to you if you don't believe me."
 
Darla cried out, "Why should we believe some crazy?"
 
I ignored her and continued with a sigh.  "While I was out with Dylan last month, shortly after Dylan told me Sam was having nightmares and had scars on his back like I have on mine I had a dream.  I dreamt of 5 other kids other than myself who Garrett was sending the same nightmare too.  A pair of glowing eyes, mine are red, but change colors if I'm scared about something else.  The eyes get closer and that's when the hooded figure starts sprouting tentacles of the elements and they lash across my back.  I can't scream.  I can't move.  Doing either only makes it worse.  When the hooded figure is in front of me with those glowing red eyes he removes the hood exposing who is really there.  But I never get to see the face clearly."
 
"You could just be reciting what the kids have been telling you.  It's almost word for word." Sam's mom said, I think her name was Lisa.
 
"I wish that were the case, but this is the first time I've met either Sam or Emma.  That was the dream I've had every night for the past 18 years.  I have it every night unless I feel completely safe.  Every morning for the past 18 years I have drawn the images I saw.  I have 18 years worth of sketches set aside that I can have brought up to my apartment if you really want to see them."
 
I hugged the two kids to me.  And spoke to Sam, "Why don't you show Emma your room?"  The both held tighter.  I reached in my back pocket and pulled out my wallet, and two cards and handed one to each kid.  "I want to show them what I recorded.  But I don't want you to see it again, to live it again.  Okay?  This is my card.  My personal number is on it.  You can call me anytime.  Night or day if you are scared alright?"
 
Sam and Emma both took the cards and looked at it.  "Can you go play?"  Sam offered Emma his hand and she took it, and the two six year olds went off down the hall.
 
I took out my phone.  "There has never been proof that Garrett was the one doing.  The footage in the fire-starter rooms just shows what you'd expect to see. The big difference between what he did with me, and the other kids was my tapes only show me with my hands on the wall and nothing else.  Because he was in my head doing the rest."  I played the video of Emma.  Her hands were against the wall and nothing else until I pounded on the door.
 
When the lash of air landed on the back of Emma the parents eyes went wide.  His small confession was lost on them as they watched him.  Dylan looked at me over my phone.  "Why didn't you kill him?"
 
I chuckled.  "Do you know me at all?"
 
"He hurt you.  He hurt Sam.  He hurt Emma and all you do is threaten him."
 
I shook my head.  "That's not all I'm going to do."
 
All four parents stood up and towered over me.  Lisa pointed a the door.  "Get the fuck out.  You don't care about our kids.  Just your reputation."
 
I sighed. Venatori sucked!  I nodded, "Fine.  But don't let Garrett near them again."
 
Tim frowned, "Like we needed you to tell us that."
 
I was at the door and I turned around with a smirk on my face and opened the door for a speedy escape.  "Well maybe if you had listened to your kids instead of thinking they made shit up they wouldn't have needed me to save them."  I stepped out of the room and slammed the door behind me.


# Calling Dad

After dealing with a bunch of dip shit parents I needed to go for a run.  I changed clothes in my apartment and then I went for a run.  I ran for a good hour before I found myself at Sage’s house.  I called my Dad while I sat down on the front stoop of his house.  I was still catching my breathe when he picked up.  “Hello?” he said.
 
“Hey Dad.  Can you pick up Drake and watch him.  I’ll come get him later?”
 
He chuckled, “What about Faelen?”
 
“He can stay in the studio when he gets out of school.  You can stop by if you are hungry I’m sure he cooks better than you do.” I teased.
 
Kai laughed, “Of course he does.  I don’t cook.  And your boys are too spoiled to eat in the cafeteria.”
 
“Will you pick up Drake?”  I asked again.
 
“Yes, son, I will, I love my grandsons.”
 
“They love you too Dad.  I’ll call if I can’t make it home, but Fae can watch Drake for the night.”
 
“They can both stay with me Nox.”
 
“Thanks Dad.”


# I Need a Break
 
I hung up the phone and walked around the side of Sage’s house and knocked on the side door where my love was still working.  He called out, “It’s unlocked.”
 
I opened the door and shut it behind me before I put my hands on his shoulders and he looked up at me with a smile. “Hey, Nox.  What do I owe this pleasure?”
 
“I needed a break.  Venatori parents are a pain in the ass.  I think that no matter what their kids say they don’t care.  And when they are given proof that their kids were wrong they blame everyone but themselves.”
 
Sage frowned as he turned back and started typing again.  He said, “That’s how most people are, I don’t think it’s solely a Venatori thing.”
 
I sighed, “You are right, but at least there are other people the kid can go to that might believe them and find the answers in your world.”
 
Sage turned in his chair and pulled me down into his lap.  “You okay?”
 
I pressed my face to his neck and nodded,”I am now.”
 
He turned back in his chair and started typing again with one hand while the other played idly with my back.  I still froze when he did it but I relaxed almost immediately into his arms. 


# Lost in Thought

I think I fell asleep in his lap because the next thing I knew he was tapping me back and whispering, “Nox.  I need to get up.”
 
I stretched as I extracted myself from his lap and he shook his head, “Like a baby.”
 
I grinned at him, “Hungry?”
 
“Always.”  Sage intoned.  And I went into the house via the stairs inside and into the kitchen to make something to eat.  The kitchen was still as gorgeous as the first time I’d seen it, but now it looked used.  Sage still burnt water - how the fuck to you burn water?  But I’d seen it happen, twice!
 
Sage’s fridge was always stocked.  Even when I wasn’t there for a few days Sage had home cooked meals.  And I didn’t bore him with my schedule of eating habits, I was learning what he liked and I made it for him even if I wouldn’t eat it.  It wasn’t the boyfriend thing I was doing, it was my thing.  The shit Sage ate he ate for convenience so I made it more convenient for him to stay home.  Sometimes Sage would ask for a full course meal so he could take it to his parents or have his friends over.  Usually I cooked those before they got there and they were hot when he wanted to show off.  I didn’t stick around I wasn’t ready to be that far indoctrinated into Sage’s life.  And he wasn’t either.    Though everyone already knew I practically lived with him.
 
It was still an argument.  It would be until things settled in, but I was working on it no matter how inactive it seemed to be.
